      "Antiretroviral drug resistance following pMTCT strategies remains a significant problem. With rapid advancements in next generation sequencing technologies, there is more focus on HIV drug-resistant variants of low frequency, or the so-called minority variants. In South Africa, AZT monotherapy for pMTCT, similar to World Health Organization option A, has been used since 2008. In 2010, a single dose of co-formulated TDF/FTC was included in the strategy for prevention of resistance conferred by single-dose nevirapine (sd NVP). The study was conducted in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, among pMTCT participants who received AZT monotherapy from 14 weeks of gestation, intrapartum AZT and sd NVP, and postpartum sd TDF/FTC. Twenty-six specimens collected at 6 weeks post-delivery were successfully sequenced using 454 ultra-deep sequencing. Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) resistance was detected in 17 of 26 (65%) patients, 2 (7%) had Thymidine analogue mutations, and 3 (11%) had K65R. Of the 17 patients with NNRTI resistance, 11 (65%) had high-level NNRTI resistance, whereas 6 (35%) had intermediate NNRTI resistance. The levels of NNRTI resistance are much higher than would be expected, given the inclusion of antepartum AZT and postpartum TDF/FTC. This high level of NNRTI resistance could impact future NNRTI-containing treatment for a large proportion of pMTCT-exposed women. The detection of Thymidine analogue mutations highlights the need to understand the clinical impact of these on AZT-containing antiretroviral treatment in women exposed to AZT monotherapy.\n",

      "Predicting with title: HIV-1 Drug Resistance by Ultra-Deep Sequencing Following Short Course Zidovudine, Single-Dose Nevirapine, and Single-Dose Tenofovir with Emtricitabine for Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission., context: ['Antiretroviral drug resistance following pMTCT strategies remains a significant problem. With rapid advancements in next generation sequencing technologies, there is more focus on HIV drug-resistant variants of low frequency, or the so-called minority variants. In South Africa, AZT monotherapy for pMTCT, similar to World Health Organization option A, has been used since 2008. In 2010, a single dose of co-formulated TDF/FTC was included in the strategy for prevention of resistance conferred by single-dose nevirapine (sd NVP). The study was conducted in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, among pMTCT participants who received AZT monotherapy from 14 weeks of gestation, intrapartum AZT and sd NVP, and postpartum sd TDF/FTC. Twenty-six specimens collected at 6 weeks post-delivery were successfully sequenced using 454 ultra-deep sequencing. Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) resistance was detected in 17 of 26 (65%) patients, 2 (7%) had Thymidine analogue mutations, and 3 (11%) had K65R. Of the 17 patients with NNRTI resistance, 11 (65%) had high-level NNRTI resistance, whereas 6 (35%) had intermediate NNRTI resistance. The levels of NNRTI resistance are much higher than would be expected, given the inclusion of antepartum AZT and postpartum TDF/FTC. This high level of NNRTI resistance could impact future NNRTI-containing treatment for a large proportion of pMTCT-exposed women. The detection of Thymidine analogue mutations highlights the need to understand the clinical impact of these on AZT-containing antiretroviral treatment in women exposed to AZT monotherapy.\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\nAlthough prevention of mother-to-child transmission (pMTCT) strategies have recently improved with the implementation of World Health Organization (WHO) options B and B plus,1 antiretroviral (ARV) drug resistance remains a significant problem in the wake of single-dose nevirapine (sd NVP)2,3 monotherapy and dual-therapy use in resource-limited settings. The current standard method for resistance testing is Sanger sequencing, or so-called population sequencing, and although widely used, it is limited since the sensitivity relies on mutations being present in 15%–20% of the HIV quasispecies.4,5 Thus, resistance conferring mutations present at low frequencies, or drug-resistant minority variants (DRMVs) will be missed by Sanger sequencing. The more sensitive technologies, commonly known as next-generation sequencing, include the Miseq and HiScan (Illumina, San Diego, CA), 454 GS-FLX and Junior (Roche Daignostics, Basel, Switzerland), Pac-Bio RS II (Pacific Biosciences, CA), and Ion-Torrent PGM (Life Technologies, Thermo Fischer Scientific, NY). Resistance testing performed using these technologies can detect DRMVs present at low frequencies.6 These DRMVs were shown to be clinically significant in studies investigating non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor–based ART.7,8 DRMVs doubled the risk of virological failure to first-line NNRTI-containing antiretroviral treatment (ART).9'], hint: None\n",

      "Predicting with title: Superior Orbital Fissure Syndrome and Ophthalmoplegia Caused by Varicella Zoster Virus with No Skin Eruption in a Patient Treated with Tumor Necrosis Alpha Inhibitor., context: ['Varicella zoster virus lies dormant in the dorsal root ganglia after symptomatic chicken pox infection, usually in childhood. If the virus reactivates in the trigeminal ganglia, it can cause varicella zoster ophthalmicus, which can have severe ocular complications. We report a case of a 73-year-old woman in severe immunosuppression due to treatment with mycophenolate mofetil, glucocorticosteroids and a tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitor. The reactivation caused superior orbital fissure syndrome, which has only rarely been described in relation to varicella zoster virus reactivation. In our case, the syndrome was seen along with severe encephalitis.\\n\\nBackground\\nThe incidence of varicella zoster virus (VZV) reactivation is increased in immunosuppressed patients, and reactivation of herpes zoster is a common adverse event reported in clinical trials with tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitors (TNF-alpha) [1].\\n\\nVaricella zoster ophthalmicus (VZO) is caused by reactivation of latent virus in the trigeminal ganglion, and ocular complications may include blepharitis, keratoconjunctivitis, iritis, scleritis and acute retinal necrosis [2]. Another ophthalmological complication is ophthalmoplegia, which can be seen in relation to VZO, and there is a slight increase in simultaneous aseptic meningitis when VZO is accompanied by ophthalmoplegia [3].\\n\\nSuperior orbital fissure syndrome (SOFS) is rare in relation to VZO, but a closely related entity named orbital apex syndrome (OAS) has been correlated with the occurrence of VZO; however, only in a few cases [2,4]. In SOFS, there is no lesion to the optic nerve in contrast to OAS, in which the optic nerve is compromised, leading to reduced visual acuity [5].\\n\\nCase Presentation\\nA 73-year-old woman with active pyoderma gangrenosum was treated with both mycophenolate mofetil and glucocorticoids for years. Due to worsening of her skin condition, she began a series of treatments with infliximab, a TNF-alpha inhibitor. She received 400 mg intravenous treatment on two occasions 14 days apart. Approximately 4 weeks after her last treatment, she started complaining of severe, right-sided, retrobulbar pain and was evaluated by an ophthalmologist. The examination only revealed slight periorbital edema.\\n\\nSeven days later, she was admitted with near-complete ophthalmoplegia of her right eye; dilated, fixed pupil; near-complete ptosis; severe, retrobulbar pain; prominent edema of the periorbital surroundings on both sides, and a feeling of altered sensibility in the area of the first trigeminal branch on the right side. The ophthalmoplegia and ptosis became complete within 12 h of admission.

After belatacept withdrawal, complete mucosal healing was observed with the persistence of a non-ulcerated left-sided colonic stricture which did not allow passage of the colonoscope. So, in patients treated with belatacept who develop digestive symptoms such as diarrhea or intestinal bleeding, we recommend performing early colonoscopy and considering belatacept withdrawal in case of suggestive endoscopic and histologic findings in order to avoid colonic sequela.\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\nBelatacept is a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) Ig fusion protein mostly used for kidney transplant rejection prophylaxis, in association with steroids and mycophenolate mofetil[1]. Belatacept selectively inhibits T cell activation and was recently demonstrated to be superior to cyclosporin in patients with renal transplants in terms of renal function with equivalent survival[2]. Frequent adverse events associated with belatacept are anemia, disturbance of bowel habits and infections, especially urinary tract infections, with no need to stop treatment in most of cases. Here, we report a case of severe stricturing Crohn’s disease (CD)-like colitis due to belatacept administration in a renal transplant recipient.\\n\\nCASE REPORT\\nWe report the case of a 62-year-old man who received a first kidney allograft from a deceased donor in September 2013. His end-stage renal disease was attributed to chronic glomerulonephritis. After an induction treatment by thymoglobulin and methylprednisolone pulses, the immunosuppression regimen consisted of tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and steroids. There was no immediate complication after transplantation and the nadir of serum creatinin was 2.24 mg/dL. Rapidly, after two months, tacrolimus was withdrawn due to nephrotoxicity (histologically proven) and replaced with everolimus which was also stopped due to development of lymphocele and proteinuria. In February 2014, belatacept was started at a dose of 5 mg/kg intravenously every month in association with mycophenolate mofetil in order to decrease corticosteroids to the level of 10 mg/d.\"], hint: None\n",

Recent advances in multiplex genotyping based on circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) provide a strong and non-invasive alternative for detection of the resistance mechanism.\\n\\n\\nMETHODS\\nHere we report a multiple metastatic NSCLC patient who was detected to have pure EGFR 19 exon deletion (negative for EML4-ALK and ROS1 in both IHC-based and sequencing assay) in the primary lesion and responded to first-line and second-line EGFR-TKI treatments (erlotinib then HY-15772). At 8 months, most lesions remained well controlled except for the liver metastases which presented dramatic progression. Considering the high risk of bleeding in rebiopsy of hepatic lesions, we conducted a multiplex genomic profiling with ctDNA. Results reported coexistence of EGFR mutation and EML4-ALK gene translocation in plasma which heavily indicated that ALK was the primary reason for progression of the liver lesions. This deduction was supported by the repeated response to ALK inhibitors (crizotinib then AP26113) of the hepatic metastases.\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nThis is the first report of the existence of ALK rearrangement in metastatic lesions in an EGFR mutated patient. It highlighted the feasibility and advantages of using ctDNA multiplex genotyping in identifying the heterogeneity across lesions and the resistance mechanism of targeted treatments.\\n\\nBackground\\nAdvances in geno-typing have changed the clinical practice of treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), especially non-squamous types where driver mutations, e.g. epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations and echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (EML4-ALK) translocation are commonly present. Agents that target EGFR activating mutations (gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib, etc.) or ALK rearrangement (crizotinib, etc.) derive significantly greater benefits than cytotoxic chemotherapy in patients who harbor these gene alterations, which is consistently proved by extensive large-scale randomized controlled trials [1, 2]. In order to deliver an appropriate first-line treatment regimen, detection of EGFR mutation and ALK rearrangement are recommended as routine genetic profiling for non-squamous NSCLC or non-smoking populations [3]. In recent years, some selective inhibitors that can overcome the resistance to first generation inhibitors of these driver alterations have also been developed, e.g., AZD9291 and CO-1686, some more effective inhibitors against both EGFR sensitizing and resistance T790M mutations [4]; or ceretinib, aletinib and AP26113, the agents that are effective for both ALK fusion and some secondary gatekeeper mutations [5].'], hint: None\n",

Magnetic resonance imaging indicated muscle edema, and the creatine kinase (CK) level increased to 29,998 U/L. Methylprednisolone (mPSL) and cyclophosphamide pulse therapy improved the patient symptoms. MMT recovered to 4 for all limbs. A muscle biopsy showed degenerated muscle fibers surrounded by neutrophil-predominant infiltration. In addition, lamina elastic breakdown and fibrinoid necrosis of arterioles were observed. A final diagnosis of microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) limited to the muscles was made.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nSystemic vasculitis usually affects multiple organ systems. Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a common cause of systemic vasculitis (1). The disease frequently affects the lungs, kidneys, and nervous and cutaneous systems. In contrast to systemic vasculitis, vasculitis limited to single organs has also been identified (2). For example, renal- and pulmonary-limited types are considered mild forms of AAV (2, 3). In addition to these major target organs, other organs can occasionally be affected. For example, otitis media with AAV (OMAAV) is considered a part of limited organ-type vasculitis (4). Hepatic aneurysm is another a rare presentation of AAV (5-8), and retinal, breast, and urogenital structures can also become target organs on occasion (9). In addition, muscles can also become a target organ of vasculitis (10-12).

According Lemaitre J et al only 22 cases of RAP have been reported in world literature until 2006 1. In a recent publication only five cases of RAP were detected after 16,808 TRA (3 out of 10,000 catheterizations, 0,03%) 2, which is significantly lower compared to frequency of femoral pseudoaneurysm (0.6%) complicating femoral access 3. The prevalence of RAP may increase in the future due to growing popularity of TRI.\\n\\nTreatment of RAPs has evolved through the years.

A retrospective chart review was performed.\\n\\n\\nRESULTS\\nFifteen episodes of P. jirovecii pneumonia in 14 patients were identified with median age of 8.3 years (range, 0.4-18.6 years). Among these patients, 11 patients had hematology-oncology diseases, 2 had primary immunodeficiency disorders (one with severe combined immunodeficiency and the other with Wiskott Aldrich syndrome), 1 had systemic lupus erythematosus and 1 received kidney transplant. Four patients were transplant recipients; 1 allogeneic and 2 autologous hematopoietic cell transplant and 1 with kidney transplant. The median absolute lymphocyte count at the diagnosis of P. jirovecii pneumonia was 5,156 cells/mm(3) (range, 20-5,111 cells/mm(3)). In 13 episodes (13 of 15, 86.7%), patients were not receiving prophylaxis at the onset of P. jirovecii pneumonia.

In the 1980s, Pneumocystis rRNA and mitochondrial DNA had been analyzed, by which this organism was identified as a fungus1). P. jirovecii belongs to the genus of Pneumocystis and is a human specific pathogen2). Serologic surveys show that most humans are infected by 2–3 years old3). In the immunocompetent children, these infections are usually asymptomatic. However, P. jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) usually occurs in severely immunocompromised hosts34). Prematurity, malnutrition in infants, immunosuppressive treatment, transplantation, primary immunodeficiency disorders and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are well-known risk factors for PCP5). PCP in immunocompromised persons can be a life threatening infection. It has been reported that up to 43% of children with cancer developed PCP before the era of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) prophylaxis and nowadays its occurrence is much less with prophylaxis3).

Although chest CT indicated SVC stenosis, cervicofacial oedema remained despite treating the SVC stenosis via balloon dilation. A skin biopsy of the erythematic sample confirmed CLC as the cause of the patient's symptoms. CLC should be considered as a differential diagnosis of cervicofacial oedema in addition to SVC syndrome, especially when it is observed in combination with skin erythema and induration. Moreover, a skin biopsy should be performed promptly for accurate diagnosis of CLC and to decide on appropriate treatment.\\n\\nBackground\\nWhen lung cancer progression causes symptoms that reduce the ability to manage daily activities, adequate symptom treatment is required.

Antiviral therapy with entecavir and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate failed to improve his symptoms, and he died of fulminant hepatic failure. Rituximab targets CD 20 receptors positive B cells. It can destroy both cancerous and normal B cells. A decline in immune function can activate occult HBV infection. Prior to initiation of rituximab therapy, screening should be conducted in all cases for HBV associated serological markers. Patients with active or occult HBV infection must be started on appropriate antiviral therapy to prevent any severe outcomes with rituximab-containing regimens.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nIn 1997, rituximab was approved for medical use and to treat non-Hodgkins B cell lymphomas. It is listed as one of the most effective and safest medicines in the health system. It binds to CD 20 receptors on B cells, leading to the destruction of B cells including both the normal and cancerous cells [1]. It is especially used to treat diseases which have a high number of B cells or are characterized by abnormal B cells. By eliminating abnormal B cells, it allows the body to make normal and healthy B cells.\\xa0Normal B cells are rapidly depleted from the peripheral blood and remain depleted until nearly six months post-treatment, followed by a slow recovery [2].

In previously described cases of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) associated with secondary ITP, treatment has consisted of nephrectomy, splenectomy, and corticosteroids. Here, we describe a case of metastatic RCC presenting with a right ventricular mass and subsequent development of secondary ITP. The clinical course was complicated by recurrent severe thrombocytopenia despite treatment with corticosteroids, rituximab, and thrombopoietin receptor agonists, precluding cancer-directed therapy and anticoagulation. Further study is needed to determine the optimal management strategy for malignancy-associated ITP.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nImmune thrombocytopenia (also referred to as immune thrombocytopenic purpura or ITP) is an autoimmune bleeding disorder characterized by isolated low platelet counts resulting from pathologic immune-mediated mechanisms. It occurs as a result of antibody-mediated targeting of platelet antigens in the setting of normal erythrocyte and leukocyte function without evidence of impaired bone marrow production. ITP is a common cause of thrombocytopenia in both children and adults, with an estimated incidence of 1.9–6.4 per 100,000 children/year and 1.6–3.9 per 100,000 adults/year [1]. Primary ITP is a diagnosis of exclusion, where no disorder or medication associated with thrombocytopenia is identified, whereas secondary ITP refers to thrombocytopenia attributable to an underlying disease or the development of drug-induced thrombocytopenia [2].\\n\\nAlthough secondary ITP is more commonly associated with rheumatologic disorders, infections, and hematologic malignancies, it is also seen in patients with solid tumor malignancies, with the highest reported cases in lung and breast cancers [3]. Approximately 20% of patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) experience some form of a paraneoplastic syndrome; however, secondary ITP associated with RCC is rare [4]. Removal of the primary tumor, corticosteroids, and splenectomy have been used to treat RCC-associated ITP with variable success [3]. Further, clinical data supporting effective therapies for patients with malignancy-associated ITP who are not surgical candidates is lacking. In this report, we describe a challenging case of secondary ITP in a patient with advanced RCC.\\n\\nCase Presentation\\nA 47-year-old female with a past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, depression, and tobacco use presented with chest pain and hemoptysis.

The development of a Bullous pemphigoid (BP)-like blistering disease, driven by autoantibodies against the hemidesmosomal protein BP180, is a potentially serious irAE whose incidence seems to be increasing. We therefore set out to characterize the clinical and (immuno)histopathological features and treatment responses of cases of BP which developed during or after CI therapy collated in six German tertiary referral centers between 2014 and 2018. We identified twelve cases of BP which emerged during and/or after CI therapy. The time interval between the initiation of CI therapy and the diagnosis of BP was 3-74 weeks (median: 23 weeks). Age at the time of diagnosis of BP varied between 62 and 80 years (median: 76 years). The clinical presentation of the patients was diverse but the severity was relatively mild when compared to that seen in most cases of spontaneous BP. Only four patients met all of the immunopathological criteria recommended in the European guidelines for the diagnosis of BP. Topical corticosteroid treatment was sufficient to achieve disease control in most patients. CI therapy could be continued in 8 out of 12 patients. In summary, our study indicates that cases of BP during or after CI therapy bear several peculiarities distinguishing them from spontaneous BP. Given the diversity of the clinical presentation of CI-induced BP the application of existing diagnostic algorithms developed for spontaneous BP can be utilized to uncover the frequency and features of CI-induced BP and to develop and optimize management algorithms.\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nCheckpoint inhibitors (CIs) constitute a new class of immunomodulatory drugs which block co-inhibitory signals on immune effector cells and result in the generation of potent T-cell mediated immune responses. Among the CIs which are currently licensed are monoclonal antibodies which target the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) or the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) pathway. For example, the first-in-class drug ipilimumab inhibits CTLA-4, nivolumab and pembrolizumab inhibit PD-1, and atezolizumab and durvalumab target the PD-1 ligand PD-L1 (1). The advent of checkpoint inhibitors has revolutionized the treatment of solid cancers. Initially licensed for the treatment of metastatic melanoma, CIs are employed in an ever increasing number of cancer entities, including Merkel cell carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, urothelial bladder cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and Hodgkin’s lymphoma (1).'], hint: None\n",

The diagnosis of VTE was made at the University Hospital Hradec Kralove (UH HK) from 2004 to 2013. VTE was objectively determined by imaging techniques (duplex ultrasonography, CT angiography) and laboratory tests (D-dimer). The average age was 46 years. The clinical manifestation of VTE was deep vein thrombosis in nine cases, including one case of simultaneous pulmonary embolism and one case of a concurrent ischemic cerebrovascular accident (iCVA). None of our patients had a history of malignant disease, trauma, or surgery. Results: Apart from antipsychotic medication, all the patients had clinical or laboratory risk factors for VTE. The most frequent clinical risk factors were obesity (n = 7) and smoking (n = 6). The most frequent laboratory risk factors were increased levels of FVIII (n = 4), mild hyperhomocysteinemia (n = 3), and factor V Leiden mutation (n = 2).

Introduction\\nCrimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is an arthropod-borne viral infection that infects domestic and wild animals and can be transmitted to humans via several routes. The causative agent of CCHF is an RNA virus of the genus Nairovirus belonging to the Bunyaviridae family of viruses (1). Over several decades, serious outbreaks with high case-fatality rates have been reported from different parts of the world, including the Middle East (2-6). CCHF is becoming a global problem, and more cases are expected to be diagnosed as the disease becomes endemic to more areas due to movement of livestock, changes in hunting activities and agricultural practices (7). A real threat exists to health care workers managing patients with CCHF and causing nosocomial outbreaks, which may have high fatality rates (8). Another concern is related to the potential use of the virus as a weapon of bioterrorism, given the limited availability of diagnostic laboratory services with Biosafety Level 4 facilities (9).\\n\\nCCHF is not endemic to UAE; however, two documented limited outbreaks occurred in 1979 and 1994 and were associated with high mortality rates among infected health care workers (10, 11).

      "Predicting with title: Real-world data of the association between quality of life using the EuroQol 5 Dimension 5 Level utility value and adverse events for outpatient cancer chemotherapy., context: [\"BACKGROUND\\nOutpatient cancer chemotherapy may lead to improved quality of life (QOL) by allowing treatment to continue without impairing the social lives of patients compared with hospitalization. However, the occurrence of serious adverse events may cause a decline in QOL. We investigated the relationship between outpatient chemotherapy-induced adverse events and QOL.\\n\\n\\nMETHODS\\nA single-center retrospective descriptive study was conducted in patients who received outpatient chemotherapy at Gifu University Hospital (Gifu, Japan) between September 2017 and December 2018. The utility values of QOL, type and severity of adverse events, type of cancer, chemotherapy regimen, and other patient demographics were analyzed. Adverse events were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. QOL was evaluated using the Japanese version of the EuroQol 5 Dimension 5 Level (EQ-5D-5L). Associations between the EQ-5D-5L utility value and serious adverse events were assessed using adjusted (age and sex) odds ratios obtained with a proportional odds logistic regression model.\\n\\n\\nRESULTS\\nData from 1008 patients who received 4695 chemotherapy cycles were analyzed. According to proportional odds logistic regression, the adverse events that significantly correlated with a decreased EQ-5D-5L utility value were malaise, edema of the limbs, peripheral neuropathy, pruritus, and dry skin. Based on the proportional odds logistic analysis, neither cancer type nor anticancer drugs were significantly correlated with the EQ-5D-5L utility value in patients who received chemotherapy. Pharmaceutical care for peripheral neuropathy significantly improved patients' EQ-5D-5L utility value from 0.747 to 0.776 (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01).\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nAdverse events (i.e., peripheral neuropathy, malaise, and edema of the limbs) are significantly correlated with a decrease in QOL, regardless of the type of cancer or anticancer drugs used. Pharmaceutical care provided by pharmacists in collaboration with physicians may improve QOL.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nThe number of patients who undergo cancer chemotherapy is increasing in parallel with the morbidity and mortality associated with cancer worldwide. Moreover, cancer chemotherapy has transitioned from inpatient to outpatient settings because of advancements in supportive care measures against cancer and changes in the healthcare environment to reduce medical costs [1–4]. Hence, patients are able to continue their personal life and work by undergoing chemotherapy in an outpatient setting. In fact, Ishiura et al.

Here we report on a case of a patient who presented with acute respiratory failure as the initial and predominant clinical manifestation after using anesthetic drugs. The diagnosis of mitochondrial myopathy was made by histochemical findings of ragged red fibers with a modified Gomori trichrome Stain in the skeletal muscle biopsy and the genetic detection of an A3243G point mutation in the tRNALeu (UUR) gene of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in a peripheral blood specimen. The patient revealed a benign clinical outcome with ventilator assistance and a cocktail treatment. Further, we performed a literature review on patients with respiratory failure as the early and predominant manifestation in adult-onset isolated mitochondrial myopathy. Eleven cases in nine studies (including our case) have been reported, and five of whom underwent DNA analysis all harbored the A3243G mutation in the tRNALeu gene of the mtDNA.

The clinical management of patients with metastatic GISTs is exceptionally challenging due to their poor prognosis. Apatinib is a multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Here, we present the unique case with metastatic GISTs who derived clinical benefit from apatinib following the failure of imatinib and sunitinib. Case presentation: A 57-year-old man was admitted to our hospital diagnosed with metastatic and recurrent GISTs following surgical resection. Fifty-four months after the first-line imatinib treatment, he developed progressive disease and then was treated with cytoreductive surgery combined with imatinib. Disease progression occurred after 7 months. He then received second-line sunitinib and achieved a progression-free survival of 11 months. Apatinib mesylate was then administered. Follow-up imaging revealed a stable disease. Progression-free survival following apatinib therapy was at least 8 months. The only toxicities were hypertension and proteinuria, which were both controllable and well-tolerated. Conclusions: Treatment with apatinib provides an additional option for the treatment of patients with GISTs refractory to imatinib and sunitinib.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nGastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal neoplasms of the gastrointestinal tract (1). Most GISTs harbor activating mutations in either gene encoding KIT or platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α (PDGFRA) (2, 3), which are type III receptor tyrosine kinases (4). After the identification of activating mutations, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are used for GISTs (5), which also significantly improved prognosis of patients with metastatic or recurrent disease (6). Imatinib mesylate is recommended as initial therapy based on drug activity and drug tolerability according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline for advanced GISTs (7). For patients with metastatic or unresectable GISTs after the failure of imatinib, sunitinib is considered (7). However, resistance to sunitinib eventually develops in most patients, after a median of 6–9 months (8). Although regorafenib can significantly improve survival as the third-line treatment, median progression-free survival (PFS) was only 4.8 months. Therefore, the development of efficacious and safe therapies is required for the treatment of metastatic or unresectable GISTs after the failure of imatinib and sunitinib.'], hint: None\n",

Her renal function deteriorated rapidly. Serum immunoglobulin and complement levels were within normal ranges. An autoantibody examination showed negative for antinuclear antibody and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody. Histologic examination of a renal biopsy specimen revealed that all of the glomeruli had severe crescent formations with no immune deposits. The patient was treated with steroid pulse therapy with cyclophosphamide followed by oral prednisolone. Fifteen days later, she experienced massive recurrent hematochezia. Angiography revealed an active contrast extravasation in a branch of the distal ileal artery. We selectively embolized with a permanent embolic agent. On the 45(th) hospital day, the patient suddenly lost consciousness. Brain computed tomography showed intracerebral hemorrhage. We report a case of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-negative pauci-immune glomerulonephritis with massive intestinal bleeding and cerebral hemorrhage.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nPauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis (GN) is one of the most common causes of rapidly progressive GN (RPGN). Most patients with pauci-immune crescentic GN have glomerular disease as part of an antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)–associated systemic vasculitis, such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, or as a part of renal-limited vasculitis [1]. Because ~75–90% of patients with pauci-immune crescentic GN have circulating ANCA, ANCA is known as a major serologic marker to distinguish pauci-immune crescentic GN from other types of RPGN [2]. Although there is little information about ANCA-negative pauci-immune crescentic GN owing to a relatively small number of patients, several studies have reported fewer systemic vasculitis manifestations in ANCA-negative crescentic GN than ANCA-positive cases. Hemorrhagic complications in pauci-immune crescentic GN are common, but massive gastrointestinal bleeding or cerebral hemorrhage in ANCA-negative pauci-immune crescentic GN has rarely been reported.

      "Predicting with title: Allergy to lidocaine injections: comparison of patient history with skin testing in five patients., context: [\"BACKGROUND\\nTrue allergy to local anesthetics, especially lidocaine, is uncommon. Most adverse reactions to this group of medications are classified as psychomotor, autonomic or toxic. In the case of suspected hypersensitivity to local anesthetics, skin testing is considered to be a useful tool - patch tests and intradermal tests for delayed hypersensitivity and skin prick tests and intradermal tests for immediate reactions. There is a particular need for such a diagnostic procedure, as patients suspected of hypersensitivity to local anesthetic drugs are frequently admitted.\\n\\n\\nOBJECTIVE\\nTo highlight the problem of hypersensitivity to local anesthetics on the basis of authors' own experience and literature data.\\n\\n\\nMETHODS\\nWe present cases of 5 patients referred to the clinic by their dentists with a suspicion of allergy to local anesthetics, four to lidocaine and 1 to articaine.\\n\\n\\nRESULTS\\nIntradermal tests were positive in 1 out of 5 subjects, with a concomitant episode of urticaria. In 1 patient we obtained a doubtful result of intradermal tests. Skin prick tests and patch tests were negative in all cases. In 2 cases we performed an incremental challenge test also with a negative result.\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nIt has to be emphasized that, although rare, consequences of true allergy to local anesthetics can be serious considering a patient's future management and therapy. That is why this diagnosis may be crucial.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nLidocaine represents the most common local anesthetic (LA) agent employed in local or regional anesthesia, included as a constituent of EMLA, a eutectic mixture of lidocaine and prilocaine [1, 2]. Although most allergic reactions are due to the common metabolic product of the ester local anesthetic, para-amino benzoic acid, cross-reactivity among esters is common. Ingredients in LA solutions such as antioxidants or preservatives including metabisulphite or parabens may also elicit allergic or adverse reactions. Articaine solutions should be avoided in those allergic or hypersensitive to sulphite, due to the content of sodium metabisulphite as the vasoconstrictor's antioxidant in it. The LA (without preservatives or adrenaline) may be skin tested.\\n\\nTrue allergy to LA is rare, with a genuine immunological reaction representing only 1% of all adverse reactions to these medications [3–5]. In traditional classifications, adverse reactions to LA have been categorized as allergic, toxic and autonomic [3]. Most of the patients undergoing dental procedures exhibit some degree of autonomic response to an injection, such as sweating, tachycardia or even syncope. However, it is usually mild and transient. Toxic reactions are mostly observed as a consequence of a rapid intra-vascular injection of LA or may be associated with an overdose in patients defectively metabolizing the drug.\"], hint: None\n",

The patient developed abdominal distension and experienced a gradual deterioration in health during 2007, with admission to The First Affiliated Hospital in May 2007. The patient presented with severe abdominal distension and breathing difficulty on May 15 and appeared to be in critical condition. Ultrasound examination revealed massive ascites and left-side pleural effusion. Thoracentesis and abdominocentesis were performed, and 300 mg carboplatin was administered intraperitoneally on May 19, followed by a second abdominocentesis on May 21. However, these treatments did not alleviate the symptoms, and 200 mg bevacizumab was administered by intravenous infusion on May 27. The condition of the patient gradually improved and 400 mg bevacizumab was administered by intravenous infusion every two weeks from June 9.

      "Predicting with title: The tacrolimus metabolism rate influences renal function after kidney transplantation., context: [\"The effective calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) tacrolimus (Tac) is an integral part of the standard immunosuppressive regimen after renal transplantation (RTx). However, as a potent CNI it has nephrotoxic potential leading to impaired renal function in some cases. Therefore, it is of high clinical impact to identify factors which can predict who is endangered to develop CNI toxicity. We hypothesized that the Tac metabolism rate expressed as the blood concentration normalized by the dose (C/D ratio) is such a simple predictor. Therefore, we analyzed the impact of the C/D ratio on kidney function after RTx. Renal function was analyzed 1, 2, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after RTx in 248 patients with an immunosuppressive regimen including basiliximab, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and prednisolone. According to keep the approach simple, patients were split into three C/D groups: fast, intermediate and slow metabolizers. Notably, compared with slow metabolizers fast metabolizers of Tac showed significantly lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) values at all the time points analyzed. Moreover, fast metabolizers underwent more indication renal biopsies (p\\u200a=\\u200a0.006) which revealed a higher incidence of CNI nephrotoxicity (p\\u200a=\\u200a0.015) and BK nephropathy (p\\u200a=\\u200a0.024) in this group. We herein identified the C/D ratio as an easy calculable risk factor for the development of CNI nephrotoxicity and BK nephropathy after RTx. We propose that the simple C/D ratio should be taken into account early in patient's risk management strategies.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nThe calcineurin-inhibitor (CNI) tacrolimus (Tac) is one of the most effective immunosuppressive drugs used for renal transplantation (RTx). In combination with mycophenolate mofetil, prednisolone and daclizumab, Tac regimen showed a superior graft function, better prevention of acute rejection and superior graft survival after 12 months compared to cyclosporine A and sirolimus [1].\\n\\nUnfortunately, Tac has a narrow therapeutic window. It can lead to acute as well as to chronic nephrotoxicity. Acute Tac nephrotoxicity due to high Tac levels typically presents early after RTx as e.g. isometric vacuolizations of tubular cells. In fact, even as early as one month after RTx, glomerulosclerosis in renal allografts can be associated to CNI nephrotoxicity. Typical chronic CNI-related allograft changes include tubule-interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy (IF/TA), tubular microcalcifications, glomerulosclerosis and artheriolar hyalinosis.

In this study, we recruited 208 current non-smokers to evaluate the effect of nicotine and its relationship to genetic risks to nicotine dependence. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, as well as measurement invariance testing, were conducted to evaluate the latent factor structures of the POMS, PANAS and DEN questionnaires across 3 nicotine doses. Structural models were used to examine the effects of nicotine and their relationship to genetic risks of nicotine dependence. We found that nicotine administration led to the change of both measurement construct and factor means, indicating the causal effect of nicotine on the psychological responses. The genotypes of rs588765 predicted the scores of the DEN Confused and Dizzy factors (p = 0.0003 and 0.001 respectively), and rs16969968 and rs588765 were associated with the PANAS Nervous factor (p = 0.006 and 0.007 respectively). Our study suggested that genetic risk of nicotine dependence is associated with acute psychological responses. The integration of psychometric analyses and dose effects could be a powerful approach for genetic study of nicotine dependence.\\n\\nIn the last several years, genetic studies of smoking and nicotine dependence have made significant progress, exemplified by the identification of the CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4 locus. Genetic variants at this locus have been shown to be associated with a number of smoking phenotypes such as the number of cigarettes smoked per day1234, nicotine dependence as defined by DSM IV56 and the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence78, age of smoking onset5910 and plasma cotinine concentration11. This locus includes the CHRNA5, CHRNA3 and CHRNB4 genes. While a non-synonymous SNP, rs16969968, in the CHRNA5 gene has emerged as a functional candidate, it may not be the one tagging the strongest association signal12.

However, GAD antibodies alone appear to be insufficient to cause SPS, and they possibly are involved in only part of its pathophysiology. It is suspected that the symptoms of SPS get precipitated by external stimuli. Here, we briefly introduce the case of a patient with latent autoimmune diabetes who developed SPS through the action of subcutaneously injected insulin. A 43-year-old man was diagnosed with diabetes and initially well-controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents but progressed to requiring insulin within 1 year of diagnosis. Two months after the initiation of basal insulin therapy, he presented with abdominal stiffness and painful muscle spasms, involving the lower limbs, which resulted in walking difficulty, and thus, he refused insulin injections thereafter. He had been treated with oral anti-diabetic agents instead of insulin for 10 years until premixed insulin twice daily was started again due to poor diabetes control. Immediately after insulin injection, abdominal muscle rigidity and spasms were noted. When insulin was not administered, frequent episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis occurred. Serum GAD antibody test was positive and there was no positivity for islet antigen-2 antibody. A glucagon stimulation test demonstrated relative insulin deficiency, indicative of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA). Tolerable muscle rigidity was achieved when the dosage of basal insulin was split into two separate daily injections with lower amounts of units per injection. This case highlights a different form of autoimmune diabetes in SPS. To our knowledge, this is the first report of SPS described shortly after the initiation of insulin therapy that required basal insulin to achieve tolerable muscle symptoms and better glucose control, without the development of diabetic ketoacidosis.\\n\\nIntroduction'], hint: None\n",

A commonly accepted risk is clozapine-induced blood dyscrasia, typically neutropenia or agranulocytosis. Neutropenia is defined as a neutrophil count of less than 1.5×109/L, occurring at a rate of 2.7% of clozapine users at 1 year.4 Patients who develop neutropenia may develop flu-like symptoms such as sore throat and pyrexia, with the peak risk occurring at 6–18 weeks. Less common is agranulocytosis, a life-threatening event defined as a neutrophil count of less than 0.5×109/L, occurring in approximately 0.8% of clozapine users at 1 year.4\\n\\nDispensing of clozapine is dependent on a satisfactory full blood count (FBC) result and maintenance of normal white blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil counts during clozapine treatment. In established clozapine-induced neutropenia or agranulocytosis, clozapine is immediately discontinued, and given the increased risk of recurrence,5 re-challenge is contraindicated. However, re-challenge may be attempted under certain conditions, for example, due to an alternative cause of the reduced neutrophil count being identified, or after careful assessment of the clinical risks and benefits. This process involves collaboration with a haematologist and may involve the co-administration of lithium or granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCS-F) in an attempt to promote granulocyte proliferation and increase the WBC and neutrophil counts. Despite carefully controlled re-challenge, a third of patients will develop a further blood dyscrasia, which is often more rapid in onset and more severe.5\\n\\nIn this report, we add to the limited existing evidence of successfully re-challenging clozapine for a third time with a patient with treatment-resistant schizoaffective disorder, following two episodes of agranulocytosis and one of episode of neutropenia.\\n\\nCase report'], hint: None\n",

Despite of extensive pretreatment with radiation and conventional chemotherapy relapse occurred and was treated with sequential high-dose chemotherapy followed by transfusion of autologous peripheral stem cells. The high-dose chemotherapy course was complicated by refractory derailment of pineal gland insufficiency. The patient achieved a complete remission after high dose chemotherapy which lasted for 13 months. Subsequently, he developed a third relapse and died.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nTumors of the pineal gland are rare accounting for 0.4 - 1% of all primary tumors of the brain [1]. Different tumor types are found in the pineal region: tumors that derive from germ cells (germinomas and \"non-germinomatous\" germ cell tumors like embryonic carcinomas and teratomas), from parenchymal cells (pinealoblastomas and pineocytomas), and from glial cells are encountered as well as lesions that represent non neoplastic cysts [2]. In all series germ cell tumors represent the most common histology (60%) [2]. The peak incidence of germ cell tumors is in the second decade [3]. In contrast to the other tumors mentioned which have no sex preference, germ cell tumors are more frequent in men than in women [1]. First symptoms are often neurological signs and complaints caused by an obstructive hydrocephalus with headache, nausea, and vomiting and/or involvement of ocular pathways. Determination of histology, tumor markers in serum and CSF, and extent of disease are critical for optimal management of pineal region tumors. Five year survival rates following radiation range from 44 - 78% and depend on extent of disease, age, radiation volume and dose to the primary site but primarily on histology [4]. The five year survival of patients with germinoma is 76% as compared with 21% for those with a \"non-germinomatous\" germ cell tumor. \\n\\nThere is no established therapy for relapsing or refractory intracranial germinoma.

Clinical examination and laboratory findings indicated a systemic process with cardiac involvement. Echocardiography revealed concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with enhanced echogenicity and preserved ejection fraction. Rectum biopsy confirmed amyloid deposition. The side effect of delayed diagnosis on prognosis and the appropriate diagnostic strategy has been discussed.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nLight-chain (AL) amyloidosis is a disorder characterized by deposition of insoluble, monoclonal immunoglobulin light-chain fragments in various tissues. Clinical features depend on organs involved but can include restrictive cardiomyopathy, nephrotic syndrome, hepatic failure, and peripheral/autonomic neuropathy. The patients often have a long period of a certain organ involved before systemic multiorgan involvement or heart failure has already developed. Cardiac involvement is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, especially in AL amyloidosis.1 Once congestive heart failure occurs in AL amyloidosis, median survival is less than 6 months if left untreated.

However many studies suggest different systemic effects related to PHPT, which could be enhanced by an abnormal cortisol release due to chronic stress of hyperparathyroidism.

He was treated with hydration, zoledronic acid, cinacalcet and high-dose unfractionated heparin. Parathyroid surgery was successfully performed, but patient's conditions suddenly worsened because of a transient thyrotoxicosis, probably induced by a previous exposure to iodine load and/or thyroid surgical manipulation. A short-term treatment with beta-blockers was introduced for symptomatic relief. The patient also presented a transient hypercortisolism with elevated ACTH, likely due to stress related not only to aging and hospitalization but also to PHPT, resolved only four months after parathyroid surgery.\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nChronic hyperparathyroidism has been linked with increased all-cause mortality. A functional chronic hypercortisolism could be established, enhancing PHPT related disorders. Only parathyroid surgery has been demonstrated to cure PHPT and complications related, showing similar outcome between older and younger patients. However, the management of post-operative period should be more careful in fragile patients. In particular, the early diagnosis and treatment of a transient post-operative thyrotoxicosis could improve recovery. Due to the increase in prevalence and the evidence of many related complications even in asymptomatic PHPT, expert opinion-based guidelines for surgical treatment of PHPT should be developed especially for elderly patients.\\n\\nBackground\\nPrimary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is the third most common endocrinopathy seen today, frequently found in the 6th to 7th decade of life. PHPT mainly is a sporadic disorder, caused in 85% of the cases by a single adenoma, in 15% by multi-gland disease and rarely by parathyroid carcinoma. Less than 10% of cases are inheritable, often associated with multi-gland hyperplasia. The most common presentation of PHPT is an asymptomatic hypercalcemia, incidentally found on routine blood tests. However, many patients may suffer from minimal symptoms such as asthenia, constipation, polyuria, hypertension and neuro-psychiatric complications [1]. In some cases a renal colic is the first presentation of the disease. In older patients, concomitant morbidity and poly-pharmacotherapy may worsen symptoms and complications, and impact the management of PHPT [2].\"], hint: None\n"

With rapid advancements in next generation sequencing technologies, there is more focus on HIV drug-resistant variants of low frequency, or the so-called minority variants. In South Africa, AZT monotherapy for pMTCT, similar to World Health Organization option A, has been used since 2008. In 2010, a single dose of co-formulated TDF/FTC was included in the strategy for prevention of resistance conferred by single-dose nevirapine (sd NVP). The study was conducted in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, among pMTCT participants who received AZT monotherapy from 14 weeks of gestation, intrapartum AZT and sd NVP, and postpartum sd TDF/FTC. Twenty-six specimens collected at 6 weeks post-delivery were successfully sequenced using 454 ultra-deep sequencing. Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) resistance was detected in 17 of 26 (65%) patients, 2 (7%) had Thymidine analogue mutations, and 3 (11%) had K65R. Of the 17 patients with NNRTI resistance, 11 (65%) had high-level NNRTI resistance, whereas 6 (35%) had intermediate NNRTI resistance. The levels of NNRTI resistance are much higher than would be expected, given the inclusion of antepartum AZT and postpartum TDF/FTC. This high level of NNRTI resistance could impact future NNRTI-containing treatment for a large proportion of pMTCT-exposed women. The detection of Thymidine analogue mutations highlights the need to understand the clinical impact of these on AZT-containing antiretroviral treatment in women exposed to AZT monotherapy.\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\nAlthough prevention of mother-to-child transmission (pMTCT) strategies have recently improved with the implementation of World Health Organization (WHO) options B and B plus,1 antiretroviral (ARV) drug resistance remains a significant problem in the wake of single-dose nevirapine (sd NVP)2,3 monotherapy and dual-therapy use in resource-limited settings. The current standard method for resistance testing is Sanger sequencing, or so-called population sequencing, and although widely used, it is limited since the sensitivity relies on mutations being present in 15%–20% of the HIV quasispecies.4,5 Thus, resistance conferring mutations present at low frequencies, or drug-resistant minority variants (DRMVs) will be missed by Sanger sequencing. The more sensitive technologies, commonly known as next-generation sequencing, include the Miseq and HiScan (Illumina, San Diego, CA), 454 GS-FLX and Junior (Roche Daignostics, Basel, Switzerland), Pac-Bio RS II (Pacific Biosciences, CA), and Ion-Torrent PGM (Life Technologies, Thermo Fischer Scientific, NY). Resistance testing performed using these technologies can detect DRMVs present at low frequencies.6 These DRMVs were shown to be clinically significant in studies investigating non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor–based ART.7,8 DRMVs doubled the risk of virological failure to first-line NNRTI-containing antiretroviral treatment (ART).9'], hint: None\n",

Of the 17 patients with NNRTI resistance, 11 (65%) had high-level resistance to NVP and EFV, whereas 6 (35%) had intermediate NNRTI resistance. One patient had both high-level NNRTI resistance and high-level resistance to TDF and 1 patient had both low to intermediate NNRTI resistance and K70R.\\n\\nOf all mutations conferring resistance to NNRTIs, the most common were those conferring high-level NNRTI resistance such as K103N in 8 of 26 (30%), V106M in 8 of 26 (30%), Y188C in 6 of 26 (23%), G190A in 4 of 26 (15%), Y181C in 3 of 26 (11%), and V106A in 3 of 26 (11%) patients. K103N and V106M were the most common mutations detected. In patients who had K103N, it was also the predominant variant within the viral population compared to the other mutations detected as minor variants only. Mutations conferring low to intermediate NNRTI resistance included K101E in 7 of 26 (27%), A98G 5 of 26 (19%), L100V 4 of 26 (15%), V108I in 1 of 26 (3%) and F227L in 1 of 26 (3%) of patients.

If the virus reactivates in the trigeminal ganglia, it can cause varicella zoster ophthalmicus, which can have severe ocular complications. We report a case of a 73-year-old woman in severe immunosuppression due to treatment with mycophenolate mofetil, glucocorticosteroids and a tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitor. The reactivation caused superior orbital fissure syndrome, which has only rarely been described in relation to varicella zoster virus reactivation. In our case, the syndrome was seen along with severe encephalitis.\\n\\nBackground\\nThe incidence of varicella zoster virus (VZV) reactivation is increased in immunosuppressed patients, and reactivation of herpes zoster is a common adverse event reported in clinical trials with tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitors (TNF-alpha) [1].\\n\\nVaricella zoster ophthalmicus (VZO) is caused by reactivation of latent virus in the trigeminal ganglion, and ocular complications may include blepharitis, keratoconjunctivitis, iritis, scleritis and acute retinal necrosis [2]. Another ophthalmological complication is ophthalmoplegia, which can be seen in relation to VZO, and there is a slight increase in simultaneous aseptic meningitis when VZO is accompanied by ophthalmoplegia [3].\\n\\nSuperior orbital fissure syndrome (SOFS) is rare in relation to VZO, but a closely related entity named orbital apex syndrome (OAS) has been correlated with the occurrence of VZO; however, only in a few cases [2,4]. In SOFS, there is no lesion to the optic nerve in contrast to OAS, in which the optic nerve is compromised, leading to reduced visual acuity [5].\\n\\nCase Presentation\\nA 73-year-old woman with active pyoderma gangrenosum was treated with both mycophenolate mofetil and glucocorticoids for years. Due to worsening of her skin condition, she began a series of treatments with infliximab, a TNF-alpha inhibitor. She received 400 mg intravenous treatment on two occasions 14 days apart. Approximately 4 weeks after her last treatment, she started complaining of severe, right-sided, retrobulbar pain and was evaluated by an ophthalmologist. The examination only revealed slight periorbital edema.\\n\\nSeven days later, she was admitted with near-complete ophthalmoplegia of her right eye; dilated, fixed pupil; near-complete ptosis; severe, retrobulbar pain; prominent edema of the periorbital surroundings on both sides, and a feeling of altered sensibility in the area of the first trigeminal branch on the right side. The ophthalmoplegia and ptosis became complete within 12 h of admission. She complained of slightly impaired vision on her right eye, but ophthalmological reevaluation revealed full visual acuity in the affected eye.

Only a few days later, her left eye also became ophthalmoplegic with fixed, dilated pupil. Ophthalmological examination revealed normal tension, clear anterior chamber and bilateral well-defined optic discs.\\n\\nDuring the admission, the patient's condition deteriorated. She became progressively encephalopathic and then unconscious. The patient died during assessment of complications related to her encephalopathy.\\n\\nDifferential Diagnosis and Tests\\nAt the initial workup, a computed tomography scan of the cerebrum including cerebral angiography was performed and found to be normal. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan with intravenous contrast and MRI venous angiography was carried out, revealing meningeal enhancement in the posterior fossa and the area around the cerebellopontine angle on the right side (fig. 2). This was strongly suspicious of basal meningitis, and a lumbar puncture showed 114 white blood cells with 96% being of lymphocytic origin. The cerebrospinal fluid was considered free of malignant cells and bacteria, but positive for VZV DNA on polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A PCR of the fluid from the right eye was also positive for VZV.\\n\\nTreatment\\nFrom the time of admission, the patient received intravenous treatment with acyclovir initially 750 mg three times per day, but the dosage of acyclovir was increased to 1,000 mg three times per day once the PCR for herpes virus family came back positive for VZV. She continued on an unaltered oral dosage of prednisone at 15 mg per day.\\n\\nDiscussion\\nReactivation of herpes zoster is more likely to happen in patients with compromised cell-mediated immunity as a result of i.e. common aging, the use of immunosuppressive therapies, or concomitant illness. The severity of the zoster outbreak is correlated with the degree of immunoincompetence [6].\\n\\nMcDonald et al. [7] found a significantly higher risk of herpes zoster in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with TNF-alpha inhibitors compared with those treated with, i.e., sulfasalazine. The patients treated with TNF-alpha inhibitors, who developed herpes zoster, were subdivided into three groups, and a significantly higher risk was associated with the use of infliximab compared to etanercept and adalimumab. Another retrospective study showed significantly greater risk when using infliximab and adalimumab compared with no TNF-alpha inhibitor treatment [8].\"], hint: None\n",

[9] described a patient treated with mycophenolate mofetil who developed hemi-cauda equina syndrome due to varicella zoster meningoradiculitis. However, this patient also had renal function impairment, which is known to increase the risk of VZV reactivation [10]. The study by Koo et al. [11] on the incidence of herpes zoster reactivation in patients after heart transplantation showed treatment with mycophenolate mofetil as an independent risk factor for herpes zoster. Using glucocorticoids has also been shown to have a significant association with varicella zoster reactivation [12].\\n\\nSOFS consists of dysfunction of the oculomotor nerve (III), the trochlear nerve (IV), the abducens nerve (VI) and the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve (V1). If there is involvement of the optical nerve (II) as well, it is called OAS. The causes of both SOFS and OAS are many, i.e. inflammation, infection, neoplasia, iatrogenic, trauma and vascular conditions [5].\\n\\nThe ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve is purely sensory. It supplies the cornea, the skin of the forehead, eyelid and nose, and it gives off branches to the tentorium cerebelli, dura mater and the posterior area of the falx cerebri [4], possibly explaining a way for the virus to reach the brain causing encephalitis and meningitis.\\n\\nThe pathogenesis of OAS in relation to VZO is thought to be related to immune complexes, direct tissue infection with the virus and/or secondary vasculitis [4]. The same is likely to be true for the SOFS when it occurs in relation to VZO.\\n\\nFollowing reactivation of VZV in the ganglion and the spread along the first branch of the trigeminal nerve, direct tissue infection and an immune response may take place within the orbit. The immune response is both humoral and cellular, resulting in inflammation with clinical manifestations of pain, hyperemia, edema, heat and loss of function. It is mediated by the release of lipid mediators, cytokines and altered vascular permeability. The involvement of orbital tissue ipsilateral to cutaneous lesions supports the notion that the pathogenesis is likely to be due to direct viral infection in the orbital cells and a consequent immune system reaction. Circulating immune complex-mediated mechanisms could, however, potentially involve the contralateral orbital tissue resulting in the same symptoms [4], explaining the involvement of the other eye in our patient.\\n\\nThe viral replication of VZV is of short duration and confined to the early stage of the disease. Antiviral therapies should be administered early to have an effect. In our patient, the first symptom of retrobulbar pain was likely due to the onset of viral replication, and the antiviral therapy was administered at a late stage of the disease.

Our patient did not have vesicular skin eruption but clearly had fluorescein uptake in the cornea.\\n\\nConclusion\\nPatients treated with TNF-alpha inhibitors, mycophenolate mofetil and glucocorticoids are at greater risk of VZV reactivation compared to patients with no such treatment. This case report highlights that herpes zoster does not always have a benign course, and caution must be taken for this category of patients. Immunologically incompetent patients with VZO should be treated with antiviral drugs at the first signs of reactivation in order to try to prevent secondary ocular complications. Oral antiviral medication should be switched to intravenous treatment in addition to corticosteroids if there is any kind of cranial nerve palsy, SOFS or OAS.\\n\\nThe patient in this case report was heavily immunosuppressed with three medications that all increase the risk of VZV reactivation. The treatment and management of VZO should be twofold: (1) systemic treatment with corticosteroids based on their anti-inflammatory effects and (2) systemic treatment with antiviral therapies. Treatment within 72 h is the most commonly suggested guideline, and fast treatment should reduce the risk of ocular complications.

At the last clinical outpatient visit in January 2017 the patient was asymptomatic with no signs of acute renal rejection.\\n\\nDISCUSSION\\nWe have described here for the first time the case of a severe stricturing CD-like colitis occurring in a patient with a kidney allograft treated with belatacept. Gastrointestinal side effects are well known in renal transplant recipients receiving immunosuppressive therapy, especially mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). Indeed, MMF has multiple side effects and those affecting the gastrointestinal tract mostly occur during the first 6 mo after the onset of treatment[3]. These side effects include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, whereas bleeding is less reported. A recent retrospective study investigated endoscopic findings in patients treated with MMF having diarrhea. In most of the cases the colonic mucosa was normal and the common lesion was simple erythema without deep ulcer or stricture[3]. Our patient had diarrhea after introduction of MMF with liquid stools but no bleeding, and this diarrhea improved after MMF withdrawal. Although acute colitis was first thought to be due to MMF, appearance of bleeding, large ulcers without erythema at colonoscopy and worsening of endoscopic lesions after MMF withdrawal led us to suspect the involvement of belatacept.'], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: Stricturing Crohn's disease-like colitis in a patient treated with belatacept., context: ['Ipilimumab and tremelimumab, two therapeutic monoclonal antibodies against CTLA-4 and prescribed in cancer patients, have previously been implicated in the development of severe and extensive forms of inflammatory bowel disease with colonic ulcerations[4]. CTLA-4 is a homologue of CD28 that binds CD80 and CD86 with higher affinity, and thereby down-regulates T cell activation. Anti CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies block its interaction with CD80 and CD86 and favour CD28 engagement and consequently T cell activation and proliferation. The overactivation of the immune system in patients treated with anti CTLA-4 antibodies associated with a specific gut microflora may explain the development of treatment-mediated CD-like colitis[5]. Abatacept and belatacept are two recombinant fusion proteins comprising a fragment of the Fc domain of human IgG1 and the extracellular domain of human CTLAA-4. Similar to CTLA-4, abatacept and belatacept compete with CD28 for CD80 and CD86 binding to block co-stimulatory signaling, thus selectively modulating T-cell activation. In comparison to abatacept, belatacept confers higher affinity for CD 80/86 ligands and has a slower dissociation rates. It could also alter regulatory T cell development, which plays an important part in intestinal inflammation. Abatacept is effective for rheumatoid arthritis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis[6], and belatacept is currently used for kidney transplant rejection prophylaxis[1]. It has been showed that abatacept was not effective for the treatment of active ulcerative colitis and CD[6]. It may be surprising that belatacept induces CD-like colitis given it has the opposite effect from anti-CTLA-4 antibodies. However, cases of colitis have been also described in patients treated with abatacept (Table 1). A first case of ulcerative colitis was reported in 2006 in a 55 year old male patient treated with abatacept for rheumatoid arthritis[7]. The diagnosis of ulcerative colitis was made 15 mo after start of abatacept and digestive symptoms improved after abatacept withdrawal and mesalamine treatment. Two other cases of ulcerative colitis developing five and 23 mo after abatacept introduction in rheumatoid arthritis patients were reported. The first one was treated with mesalamine and infliximab and the second one with prednisolone and mesalamine[8]. Similarly to these case reports, the severe colitis occurred 23 mo after belatacept introduction in our patient. Macroscopically, the endoscopic lesions were more in favor of CD compared to abatacept-induced colitis, and the large deep ulcerations were similar to anti CTLA-4 enterocolitis. The histological findings in our patients described acute colitis with polymorph leucocyte infiltration and crypt abscesses without atrophy, distortion, branching or budding of crypts. These findings were also described in abatacept and anti CTLA-4 colitis. The most striking finding in our case is the development on belatacept treatment of an inflammatory stricture of the left colon. After belatacept withdrawal and pre'], hint: None\n",

It may be a direct effect of belatacept, which could alter the development of regulatory T cells, and therefore lead to uncontrolled intestinal inflammation. Another hypothesis may be an indirect effect of belatacept which confers a profound immunosuppression leading to the development of infectious colitis. Cytomegalovirus colitis was ruled out by careful histologic examination and negative PCR analyses in the blood and in colonic biopsies. PCR in biopsies was however, strongly positive for HHV-6. HHV-6 reactivation in patients with solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been reported to be associated with intestinal disease[9,10]. Moreover, HHV-6 was found in colonic mucosa of inflammatory bowel disease patients in 44% of the cases and associated with disease activity and use of immunosuppressive therapy[11]. HHV-6 intensity also correlated with endoscopic severity in ulcerative colitis. After belatacept withdrawal and mucosal healing, PCR for HHV-6 in colonic biopsies was found to be negative or slightly positive in our patient.\\n\\nThus, we report here a case of CD-like colitis in a patient treated with belatacept. Despite belatacept withdrawal, the patient developed a severe colonic stricture which may impact quality of life and necessitate subsequent colonic surveillance. Therefore in patients treated with belatacept who develop digestive symptoms such as diarrhea or intestinal bleeding, we recommend performing early colonoscopy and considering belatacept withdrawal in case of suggestive endoscopic and histologic findings.\\n\\nCOMMENTS\\nCase characteristics'], hint: None\n",

Recent advances in multiplex genotyping based on circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) provide a strong and non-invasive alternative for detection of the resistance mechanism.\\n\\n\\nMETHODS\\nHere we report a multiple metastatic NSCLC patient who was detected to have pure EGFR 19 exon deletion (negative for EML4-ALK and ROS1 in both IHC-based and sequencing assay) in the primary lesion and responded to first-line and second-line EGFR-TKI treatments (erlotinib then HY-15772). At 8 months, most lesions remained well controlled except for the liver metastases which presented dramatic progression. Considering the high risk of bleeding in rebiopsy of hepatic lesions, we conducted a multiplex genomic profiling with ctDNA. Results reported coexistence of EGFR mutation and EML4-ALK gene translocation in plasma which heavily indicated that ALK was the primary reason for progression of the liver lesions. This deduction was supported by the repeated response to ALK inhibitors (crizotinib then AP26113) of the hepatic metastases.\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nThis is the first report of the existence of ALK rearrangement in metastatic lesions in an EGFR mutated patient. It highlighted the feasibility and advantages of using ctDNA multiplex genotyping in identifying the heterogeneity across lesions and the resistance mechanism of targeted treatments.\\n\\nBackground\\nAdvances in geno-typing have changed the clinical practice of treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), especially non-squamous types where driver mutations, e.g. epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations and echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (EML4-ALK) translocation are commonly present. Agents that target EGFR activating mutations (gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib, etc.) or ALK rearrangement (crizotinib, etc.) derive significantly greater benefits than cytotoxic chemotherapy in patients who harbor these gene alterations, which is consistently proved by extensive large-scale randomized controlled trials [1, 2]. In order to deliver an appropriate first-line treatment regimen, detection of EGFR mutation and ALK rearrangement are recommended as routine genetic profiling for non-squamous NSCLC or non-smoking populations [3]. In recent years, some selective inhibitors that can overcome the resistance to first generation inhibitors of these driver alterations have also been developed, e.g., AZD9291 and CO-1686, some more effective inhibitors against both EGFR sensitizing and resistance T790M mutations [4]; or ceretinib, aletinib and AP26113, the agents that are effective for both ALK fusion and some secondary gatekeeper mutations [5].'], hint: None\n",

FISH, RT-PCR and Ventana IHC are all currently accepted methods for detection of ALK rearrangement. In recent years, the development and advances in high throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS) have allowed the simultaneous profiling of alterations in multiple genes [6]. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is released or excreted by tumour cells and circulates in the blood of a cancer patient; analysis of the fraction of mutant-alleles from ctDNA compared to normal-alleles from the patients’ normal genome provides opportunities for minimally-invasive cancer diagnosis and tumor monitoring [7]. Detection with ctDNA, which originates from all potential lesions, could overcome the disadvantages of single site biopsy given that the intra-tumoral and inter-lesional heterogeneity is common [6, 8]. Enrichment of plasma ctDNA and incorporation with the next generation deep sequencing techniques allow us to simultaneously detect the gene alterations of interest, e.g. EGFR/BRAF/HER2 mutations, ALK/ROS1/RET rearrangements, MET amplification, etc. in NSCLC, especially when it is difficult to obtain sufficient tissue samples.\\n\\nEGFR mutations and ALK rearrangement are generally considered to be mutually exclusive. However, some recent surveys and case reports showed co-existence of the two alterations within the same lesion [9, 10]. Here, we report an advanced NSCLC case with EGFR exon 19 deletion who experienced single-site progression in the liver after primary response to EGFR-TKI treatments and showed good response when adding crizotinib after the detection of ALK rearrangement signal through ctDNA. This special case highlights the feasibility and necessity of using ctDNA multiplex genomic profiling as an alternative approach in molecular diagnosis of NSCLC or in the exploration of the underlying mechanism in resistance to targeted therapies.

Thus, we firstly withdrew erlotinib and delivered methylprednisolone pulse therapy (500\\xa0mg qd * 5\\xa0days). However, no improvement was observed, which lead us to the diagnosis of lymphangitis carcinomatosa due to disease progression. Pemetrexed 0.8\\xa0g plus bevacizumab 300\\xa0mg (the tumor board decided to use a platinum-free regimen due to low tolerance to platinum of this patient, ECOG performance score 2–3), was then administered, but the lesions continued to grow rapidly.

In this case, the progressed liver metastases were large, bulky, and scattered. Radiotherapy or radiofrequency ablation was not an appropriate option. Metastatic hepatic lesions were supplied by portal vein system rather than hepatic artery system. Thus, transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) might not derive significant benefits. On the other hand, this case progressed dramatically after showing resistance to EGFR-TKIs. In this case, switching to chemotherapy is suggested according to what IMPRESS trial indicated [12]. Considering the previous evidence of the patients’ insensitivity to pemetrexed, we decided to use gemcitabine single agent chemotherapy. Meanwhile, we continued the use of HY-15772 API since all extra-hepatic lesions remained stable or even undetectable in the images, which suggested these lesions remained sensitive to HY-15772 API.'], hint: None\n",

In this case, as the entire left lobe of the liver was occupied by metastatic lesions that were loosened in structure, multidisciplinary consultation opinions suggested that conducting a fine-needle biopsy would be dangerous due to the high risk of bleeding. Recent advances in non-invasive rebiopsy approaches such as multiplex genomic profiling of ctDNA provided us an alternative [13]. We decided to obtain peripheral blood from this patient to perform a NSCLC-related multiplex genotyping, in order to clarify the resistance mechanism. Surprisingly, in addition to the 19del EGFR mutation that was previously discovered in the primary lesion, EML4-ALK fusion with relatively high abundance in plasma was detected. Given that the extra-hepatic lesions were all under control, indicating their lasting response to HY-15772 API, we added Crizotinib, the only approved agent to inhibit ALK-driving tumors, to the regimen without withdrawing the EGFR suppressor. Previous reports suggested no significant superimposed toxicity in dual treatment with EGFR and ALK inhibitors [14]. In this case, the patient presented rapid relief without any grade III adverse events. Undoutedly, the timely addition of ALK inhibitors salvaged the patient as previous gemcitabine showed no efficacy.\\n\\nThough some previous studies reported co-existence of EGFR and ALK in the same lesions, this is the first report showing ALK rearragement in distant metastatic lesions in a patient potentially harboring pure EGFR mutations in the primary lesion. Since rebiopsy for the liver metastases in the left lobe was not an option in this case, we had no direct evidence that the liver progression was driven by ALK fusion. However, the great abundance of EML4-ALK fusion signals in the plasma upon disease progression and the significant response after adding crizotinib (as well as the AP26113 API after resistance to crizotinib) strongly supported the existence of ALK fusion in the growing liver metastases. In addition, it was not likely that the primary lesion harbored concurrent EGFR mutation and ALK fusion because both routine ARMS and NGS re-analysis showed that no ALK fusion was detected and the pulmonary lesions were all in good control by HY-15772 API when the hepatic metastases progressed. Such heterogeneity might be more common than we have previously acknowledged, and might have a great impact on treatment strategy. In the past, we could only detect genetic alterations with site by site tissue samples. It was too difficult to obtain tissues from all lesions; multiplex genotyping with ctDNA might help address this issue. Thus, with the current technology, we should reevaluate the heterogeneity across different lesions and their incidence.

Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a common cause of systemic vasculitis (1). The disease frequently affects the lungs, kidneys, and nervous and cutaneous systems. In contrast to systemic vasculitis, vasculitis limited to single organs has also been identified (2). For example, renal- and pulmonary-limited types are considered mild forms of AAV (2, 3). In addition to these major target organs, other organs can occasionally be affected. For example, otitis media with AAV (OMAAV) is considered a part of limited organ-type vasculitis (4). Hepatic aneurysm is another a rare presentation of AAV (5-8), and retinal, breast, and urogenital structures can also become target organs on occasion (9).

The degree of muscle weakness was similar in the proximal and distal muscles. The patient reported pain in the extremities as intense; however, no sensory disorders were detected. The consciousness level was clear. The neck flexor/extensor muscles were not affected, and dysarthria and dysphagia were not obvious. Cranial nerve disorder was also not apparent. The patient could describe his symptoms by himself. Dark urine was observed on day 8. Serum CK levels increased to 29,998 IU/mL, and serum creatinine levels increased to 1.34 mg/dL. We performed a muscle biopsy of the left gastrocnemius on day 8. On the same day, the proteinase 3 (PR3)-ANCA titer was found to be 65.8 U/mL. In contrast, the results for other auto-antibodies, including myeloperoxidase (MPO-ANCA), were negative (Table 2).

Traditional extrinsic compression with radial flow cessation leads to a local milieu likely associated with an increase in probability of radial artery occlusion (RAO). Our technique involves obtaining ipsilateral radial artery access distal to the neck of the RAP followed by a prolonged sheath dwell time covering the neck of the RAP which allows the RAP sac to thrombose and maintains radial artery lumen patency. © 2016 The Authors. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\nRAP is a rare complication of transradial access (TRA) and can occur as a sequela of arterial wall trauma and inadequate hemostasis after TRI. According Lemaitre J et al only 22 cases of RAP have been reported in world literature until 2006 1. In a recent publication only five cases of RAP were detected after 16,808 TRA (3 out of 10,000 catheterizations, 0,03%) 2, which is significantly lower compared to frequency of femoral pseudoaneurysm (0.6%) complicating femoral access 3. The prevalence of RAP may increase in the future due to growing popularity of TRI.\\n\\nTreatment of RAPs has evolved through the years. Initially surgical treatment was the dominant form of management for RAP. Subsequently, many cases have been treated with ultrasound‐guided mechanical compression. Recently, thrombin injection under ultrasound guidance has become the preferred treatment method.\\n\\nWe describe a novel technique for treatment of RAP using ipsilateral radial artery catheterization with long introducer sheath placement and gentle mechanical compression isolating the pseudoaneurysm with resultant cessation of flow in the sac, thrombosis and subsequent closure.\\n\\nCASE PRESENTATION\\nA 68‐year‐old man with previous posterior MI, persistent atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and moderately depressed left ventricular function (EF\\u2009=\\u20090,44) was admitted with life‐style limiting CCS class III angina. Diagnostic coronary angiography and possible PCI was planned using radial access. He underwent cardiac catheterization from the right radial using a 16 cm 6F hydrophilic introducer sheath (Terumo Interventional Systems, Japan). The radial artery had an anomalous origin from the mid‐segment of brachial artery. Coronary stenoses were identified in the right coronary artery (RCA) and PCI was planned as a second stage in 2–3 weeks. At the time of diagnostic examination patient was on warfarin therapy and additional clopidogrel was prescribed for the forthcoming PCI procedure. The International Normalized Ratio (INR) at the time of angiography was 1.09. The sheath was removed and hemostasis was achieved using TR band (Terumo Interventional Systems, Japan). Patient was discharged 6 hr after diagnostic procedure and a small hematoma was noted after removal of hemostatic device without any signs of bleeding.'], hint: None\n",

This swelling appeared 48 hr following discharge after lifting a heavy object with the right hand. A systolic bruit was audible over the mass and duplex ultrasonography demonstrated an oval‐shape dual chamber pseudoaneurysm measuring 49 X 38 mm, partially filled with thrombus. Pseudoaneurysm sac was connected to the radial artery lumen through a long (6 mm) and narrow (2 mm in diameter) neck (Fig. 2). Radial artery was patent and INR at the time of repeat hospitalization was 1.57.\\n\\nFigure 1 Pulsatile swelling at the right wrist just proximal to the previous puncture point of radial artery (arrow).\\n\\nFigure 2 Duplex ultrasonography demonstrated dual chamber (arrowheads) pseudoaneurysm of radial artery (RA) with turbulent blood flow and narrow neck connection (arrow) with RA lumen. Pseudoaneurysm sac was partially filled with thrombotic mass.\\n\\nAt this point we contemplated a combined strategy of PCI of RCA and repair of RAP.\\n\\nWe decided to use the affected radial artery as the access site for PCI, because ultrasonography indicated presence of sufficient length and diameter of intact artery distal to RAP for puncture and catheterization. After successful puncture of radial artery distal to RAP, a small vessel dilator (5F) was inserted into RA lumen and retrograde radial artery angiography was performed using low pressure manual contrast injection. Radial artery angiography confirmed RA patency and significant deviation of its anatomic course at the site of RAP was seen with the signs of RA lumen narrowing as a result of extrinsic RA compression (Fig. 3a). Pseudoaneurysm was visualized with turbulent blood flow into aneurysm sac with QCA measured dimensions of 38.7 X 36.8 mm. After advancing a 0.014” Prowater guidewire (Asahi Intecc, Japan), a 21cm 6F hydrophilic introducer sheath (Terumo Interventional Systems, Japan) was placed covering the neck of RAP therefore isolating the aneurysm sac from the blood circulation (Fig. 3b). PCI of RCA was performed through the 6F sheath (procedure duration 34 min) using a 6 French JR4 guide catheter, 0.014” Prowater guidewire (Asahi Intecc, Japan) and 3.5–15 mm Xience drug‐eluting stent. 70 Units/Kg of unfractionated heparin was administered intravenously at the beginning of the procedure. The sheath was left in RA lumen after completion of PCI for 8 hr. The sheath was attached to a pressurized heparinized saline flush using a standard arterial line setup, with 500 units/hour of heparin administered via the sheath in a monitored post‐procedure unit.

Over time, arterial blood flow under high pressure creates a cavity outlined by inflammatory cells and fibroblasts subsequently replaced by fibrous tissue and the inner surface covered by endothelium.\\n\\nDevelopment of femoral artery pseudoaneurysm (FAP) is described well in literature with a reported incidence of 0.2% for diagnostic and 0.8% for interventional transfemoral procedures 4, 5. In contrast, the real world incidence of radial artery pseudoaneurysm (RAP) is unknown, probably because of lower incidence and underreporting. During the period of 2003‐2015 in our institution we detected only 4 RAP cases out of 17,204 diagnostic and interventional transradial catheterization procedures (0.02%).'], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: New technique for treatment of postcatheterization radial artery pseudoaneurysm., context: [\"Many small postcatheterization pseudoaneurysms tend to spontaneously thrombose over time 5. However, large pseudoaneurysms which do not thrombose spontaneously, should be treated, because potential complications of RAP may be nearby venous compression, thromboembolism and rupture with significant bleeding requiring urgent surgery 6, 7. Until recently, the standard technique of treatment has been surgical repair including radial artery ligation, patch angioplasty using vein segment, RAP ligation and excision with end‐to‐end anastomosis 8, 9, 10. During the past decade several minimally invasive methods have been introduced that have largely replaced surgical treatment. Most common techniques are ultrasound‐guided compression 2, 11, 12 and percutaneous thrombin injection into RAP sac under ultrasound guidance 2, 13, 14.\\n\\nUltrasonographically guided compression is associated with a high success rate 11, 12, but this technique also has significant limitations, including decreased success rate for patients taking long‐term anticoagulation therapy 11, 15 and prolonged compression time, often resulting in patient discomfort and pain. Sometimes there are recurrences after compression therapy subsequently requiring further compression attempts or surgery 16. Moreover, pseudoaneurysm with relatively rigid fibrous wall require prolonged forceful compression that may cause occlusion of small caliber radial arteries, despite use ultrasound guidance, as cessation of radial artery flow during compression has been identified a risk factor for subsequent radial artery occlusion (RAO) 17, as well as prolonged compression of the artery 18.\\n\\nUltrasound‐guided thrombin injection is a quick and more effective technique in almost all cases even in patients with anticoagulation therapy. However, direct thrombin injection into pseudoaneurysm sac is not without risk. The unattended escape of thrombin into adjacent main artery can result in thromboembolism to the distal arterial bed, resulting in necrosis 19. In recent publication Zegri et al described a case of asymptomatic RAO after thrombin injection in RAP sac2. Teh et al described a case of thrombin injection into temporal artery pseudoaneurysm with unexpected outcome of seizure and scalp necrosis 6. In another publication D'Achille et al presented a case where thrombin injection in RAP sac led to distal skin changes suggesting distal vessel embolization after possible thrombin entry in arterial circulation 20. Other reported complications included anaphylaxis 21 or generalized urticaria after bovine thrombin injection and pseudoaneurysm rupture 19.\"], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: New technique for treatment of postcatheterization radial artery pseudoaneurysm., context: ['Taking into account all issues mentioned above, we decided to use of lumen‐based flow interruption in the RAP sac using insertion of 6F arterial sheath into radial artery covering the RAP neck and protected the radial artery against external compression related consequences, such as RAO. The stasis of blood in RAP sac facilitates thrombosis of the sac and resolution of pseudoaneurysm, without the need of external compression. Moreover, if needed we can safely inject thrombin into RAP sac after covering RAP neck by the sheath without the risk of thrombin entry into the arterial circulation.\\n\\nInitial angiography demonstrated significant deviation and stenosis of RA at the site of RAP and solely mechanical compression even ultrasound guidance did not guarantee radial artery patency and sheath was protected arterial lumen against external mechanical compression. In general, arterial sheath acts as a temporary covered stent, which can be removed after successful closure of RAP. Permanent covered stents has been utilized with good results in treatment of pseudoaneurysms of large caliber arteries 22, but in radial artery with mean diameter less than 2.5 mm, use of permanent covered stents may be risky. For prevention of radial artery closure after long dwell time of the arterial sheath, patent hemostasis technique should be used after sheath removal to prevent RAO 23.\\n\\nPossible contributing cause of RAP formation in our case was inadequate index hemostasis with an adverse influence of long‐term systemic anticoagulation therapy, which likely facilitated persistent communication between main artery and pseudoaneurysm sac. Earlier, Collins et al. noted that full anticoagulation therapy, rather than inadequate compression, was a potential contributing factor for development of RAP 8. While radial artery access is favored in such high risk patients to avoid bleeding complications, ongoing anticoagulation therapy may predispose to RAP formation. Prolonged non‐occlusive hemostatic compression, as well as other measures such as, use of smaller diameter introducer sheath, temporary interruption of anticoagulation therapy and surveillance for RAP (palpation of radial puncture site, ultrasound examination) during follow‐up after TRI procedure, may lower the incidence and aid in early detection of RAP.\\n\\nDespite the success of temporary radial artery occluding technique with arterial sheath for nonsurgical RAP treatment some questions remain and require further investigation, such as optimal sheath/radial artery diameter ratio, appropriate sheath dwell time in the artery for reliable RAP closure and monitoring after successful RAP closure.\\n\\nCONCLUSION'], hint: None\n",

In the 1980s, Pneumocystis rRNA and mitochondrial DNA had been analyzed, by which this organism was identified as a fungus1). P. jirovecii belongs to the genus of Pneumocystis and is a human specific pathogen2). Serologic surveys show that most humans are infected by 2–3 years old3). In the immunocompetent children, these infections are usually asymptomatic. However, P. jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) usually occurs in severely immunocompromised hosts34). Prematurity, malnutrition in infants, immunosuppressive treatment, transplantation, primary immunodeficiency disorders and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are well-known risk factors for PCP5). PCP in immunocompromised persons can be a life threatening infection. It has been reported that up to 43% of children with cancer developed PCP before the era of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) prophylaxis and nowadays its occurrence is much less with prophylaxis3). However, certain immunocompromised patients still develop PCP56).

He did not receive any prophylaxis before both episodes of PCP. The patient was recovered from the first episode of PCP after TMP/SMX and pentamidine combination therapy with steroid. Ten years later, he developed the second episode of PCP and was treated with TMP/SMX and caspofungin combination therapy with steroid.

Secondly, there was 1 patient who developed PCP before the engraftment after HCT and did not have a chance to start PCP prophylaxis. Thirdly, there was one patient who developed PCP after the termination of recommended PCP prophylaxis period. Fourthly, in cases of primary immunodeficiency disorders, the 2 patients presented with PCP as one of the initial manifestations before being diagnosed with primary immunodeficiency disorders.

Severe respiratory failure patients who needed the mechanical ventilator increased mortality rate up to 60% to 75%. Steroid is frequently used in PCP cases. However, unlike HIV patients in whom steroid use appeared beneficial8), there have been conflicting reports on steroid use in non-HIV patients with PCP9). Nine (9 of 15, 60%) of our patients also received steroid and all of the patients who needed ICU cared received steroid. Among the 9 patients treated with steroid, 3 patients (33.3%) died.

For the second episode, he received TMP/SMX and caspofungin combination therapy with steroid but failed to recover from the infection and died of respiratory failure aggravation. It is not clear whether caspofungin was not efficacious in treating PCP in this patient because he also had IPA.

We report a case of lung cancer with CLC that caused both superior vena cava (SVC) stenosis and cervicofacial oedema, suggestive of SVC syndrome. A 64-year-old woman with lung adenocarcinoma presented with cervicofacial oedema and erythema, followed by severe dyspnoea 2 months after four cycles of carboplatin, pemetrexed and bevacizumab triplet therapy. Although chest CT indicated SVC stenosis, cervicofacial oedema remained despite treating the SVC stenosis via balloon dilation. A skin biopsy of the erythematic sample confirmed CLC as the cause of the patient's symptoms. CLC should be considered as a differential diagnosis of cervicofacial oedema in addition to SVC syndrome, especially when it is observed in combination with skin erythema and induration. Moreover, a skin biopsy should be performed promptly for accurate diagnosis of CLC and to decide on appropriate treatment.\\n\\nBackground\\nWhen lung cancer progression causes symptoms that reduce the ability to manage daily activities, adequate symptom treatment is required. Superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome is a major complication of lung cancer that occurs when the lung tumour compresses the SVC extrinsically, which causes cervicofacial oedema and dyspnoea.1 Among treatment options for SVC syndrome, an indwelling SVC stent effectively improves symptoms within a few days.1 Cutaneous lymphangitis carcinomatosa (CLC), a rare condition that accounts for less than 5% of cutaneous metastases, also causes cervicofacial oedema,2 and patients with CLC usually present with progressive lymphoedema and erythema.3 Here, we report a rare case of lung adenocarcinoma with CLC and SVC stenosis in a patient whose cervicofacial oedema and dyspnoea remained despite improving SVC blood flow via balloon dilation.\\n\\nCase presentation\\nA 64-year-old woman with a 20-pack-year smoking history presented with a persistent cough for 3 months. Chest CT showed a 10\\xa0mm-diameter nodule in the right upper lobe of her lung and swelling of the supraclavicular, mediastinal and right hilar lymph nodes. Tissue samples obtained via mediastinoscopy indicated adenocarcinoma harbouring EGFR mutations: G719S (exon 18) and T790M (exon 20). Enhanced brain MRI showed frontal and occipital brain metastases. Thus, the patient was diagnosed with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma (cT1aN3M1b) based on the seventh edition of the Union for International Cancer Control Tumour–Node–Metastasis classification of Malignant Tumours.

This disease course is typical of SVC syndrome, which was the main cause of the symptoms. SVC syndrome arises from the compression of thin-walled SVC by enlarged paratracheal lymph nodes, mostly caused by lung cancer.1 The common symptoms of SVC syndrome include neck swelling, dyspnoea, facial swelling, cough and dilated chest collateral veins.1 Contrast-enhanced CT may elucidate the cause and extent of venous obstruction in SVC syndrome. The initial treatment in emergent cases of SVC syndrome is endovascular stenting of the SVC to restore flow. SVC stenting is reported to improve symptoms of SVC syndrome within 1–3 days, and recurrence rarely occurs.1 In the present case, SVC blood flow remained despite its prominent stenosis, and symptoms improved for only a few hours. The rapid recurrence of symptoms is atypical for SVC syndrome and indicates that there were other causes that made the patient’s symptoms more intractable.\\n\\nIn the present case, the patient presented with induration of the chest and abdomen, and a prompt skin biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of CLC. CLC is a rare form of skin metastases that exhibits extensive dermal and subcutaneous lymphatic invasion. This subcutaneous lymphatic invasion results in lymphoedema and diffuse skin erythema mimicking an infectious process, which differs from the typical form of cutaneous metastases such as nodules or masses.3–6 The incidences of cutaneous metastases in patients with metastatic cancer and with lung cancer are approximately 5% and 1.7%–3.1%, respectively; CLC accounts for approximately 5% of all cutaneous metastases.2 7 The most common histological feature observed in patients with lung cancer who develop CLC is adenocarcinoma, as in the present case.8 Cutaneous metastasis in lung cancer tends to occur in order in the anterior chest wall, back and abdomen.7 9–11 Cutaneous metastases are considered a late event in the evolution of the majority of malignancies.9 Lung cancer is the quickest to metastasise to the skin (15.75 months) among solid tumours.3 The average survival time from the appearance of CLC in lung cancer (less than 3 months) is shorter than that from the appearance of cutaneous metastasis (3 to 5 months).3 7 12 The only known treatment for CLC is systemic chemotherapy, but early diagnosis can lead to earlier anticancer treatment.8 Osimertinib may improve the prognosis of the patients harbouring the EGFR T790M mutation; however, osimertinib was not available for treatment at the time of this diagnosis.13–15 Supportive care for lymphoedema due to CLC, as follows, can improve patients’ quality of life and may even influence the progression of the disease: manual lymph drainage, compression therapy with bandages or special stockings, dermatological skin\\xa0care and psychological treatment.3'], hint: None\n",

Since then, only a few hundred cases have been reported. It was reported mostly in Asian patients as sporadic case reports and small case series [2]. Colorectal SRCC is very rare, comprising less than 1% of colorectal cancer (CRC) cases [3]. SRCC and mucinous adenocarcinoma (MAC) with signet cells are two overlapping entities. SRCC can occur within the pools of MAC or in a diffusely infiltrative process with minimal extracellular mucin in a linitis plastica [4]. On the other hand, the World Health Organization (WHO) defined MAC as a carcinoma confirmed by > 50% of extracellular mucin pools that contain malignant epithelial or individual tumor cells including SRCC [4]. SRCC mainly occurs on the right side of the colon [5]. The main differential diagnosis is metastatic gastric carcinoma with SRCC, and it is necessary to rule out this diagnosis by endoscopy before finalizing a diagnosis of primary colorectal SRCC. SRCC is associated with poor prognosis. Despite the rarity of SRCC, it is more frequently associated with patients with ulcerative colitis [6].

      "Predicting with title: A Rare Case of Signet Cell Carcinoma of Transverse Colon in a Young Patient With Ulcerative Colitis., context: ['CRC is the third most common cancer. In the USA, annually, approximately 145,600 new cases of large bowel cancer are diagnosed, of which 101,420 are colon and the remainder are rectal cancers [7]. Annually, approximately 50,630 Americans die of CRC, accounting for approximately 8% of all cancer deaths [6]. More than 90% of CRC cases are adenocarcinomas [8]; however, several histological variants have been distinguished such as mucinous, signet ring cell, medullary, adenosquamous, micropapillary, spindle cell and undifferentiated [8]. Signet cell carcinoma is a subtype of colon cancer. The name SRCC is a descriptive term describing a carcinoma cell retaining abundant intracytoplasmic mucin that causes the nucleus to be pushed to the periphery of the cell. In affected sites, the tumor infiltrates the entire wall, therefore results in a rigid and contracted structure called the linitis plastica [5]. The majority of these tumors arise in the stomach. However, it was also described in breast, lung, bladder, pancreas, gallbladder and the colon. It is a rare tumor comprising less than 1% of all CRC cases [2]. SRCC is predominant in males with a ratio of 2:1. Belli et al reported the most common location is the right side of the colon [9]. Our patient is a young man and had the tumor on the transverse colon. These tumors can be classified into either MAC with signet cell (a subtype of MAC) or SRCC. WHO definition of SRCC is carcinoma confirmed by > 50% of SRCC but states that SRCC can occur within the pools of MAC or in a diffusely infiltrative process with minimal extracellular mucin in a linitis plastica pattern [9]. Luis et al described in his retrospective study that 68.7% of SRCC cases occur in the right colon, 9.4% in the transverse and 21.9% in the left colon [5]. Our patient had the tumor on the transverse colon. Of the patients, 43.7% present with metastasis, whereas 64.3% of cases metastasize to the peritoneum, 46.5% present with lymph node metastasis (LNM) (mean of 14.3 positive lymph nodes), 62.5% with lymphovascular invasion and 25% with perineural invasion [5]. However, in the same study when SRCC was compared to MAC with signet cell, SRCC showed some distinctive characteristics. Patients presented a decade later (65 versus 56.5 years in comparison to MAC) as well as, in a higher clinical stage [5].\\n\\nThe pathogenesis of colorectal SRCC has not been fully understood yet. Tendon et al reported adenoma to carcinoma sequence for colorectal SRCC [10]. However, it is believed that SRCC may have a different mode of pathogenesis [11]. Hartman et al reported that precursor adenomatous lesions were more frequently observed in mucin-rich SRCC, and not in mucin-poor SRCCs [12]. There is an association between ulcerative colitis and SRCC. Colitis-associated carcinogenesis (CAC) leads to development of cancer through a different carcinogenic pathway known as the inflammation-metaplasia-dysplasia-carcinoma sequence with earlier identified molecular changes in TP531 [6].'], hint: None\n",

Together they represent about 30% of tumors with these genetic features [12]. The impact of MSI on survival in colorectal SRCC has not been confirmed to have a prognostic value on survival [12]. It is most likely due to small size of previous studies. Further research is required to confirm or reject this hypothesis [13]. In our patient DNA mismatch repair (MMR) protein analysis was performed. Analyses for MLH-1, MSH-2, MSH-6 and PMS2 were all normal. Mutations in the ras gene family (K-ras, H-ras and N-ras) are found in about 50% of CRCs. Ninety-five percent of ras mutations are identified at k-ras gene, with 80% at codon 12 and 15% at codon 13 [13]. There are limited data in the literature on ras gene mutations in colorectal SRCC.\\n\\nColitis-associated signet cell carcinoma in situ is associated with alterations of TP53 and CDH1 genes, resulting in a low expression of E-cadherin protein which impairs cell-cell adherence junctions and cell-proliferation signaling pathways.

Antiviral therapy with entecavir and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate failed to improve his symptoms, and he died of fulminant hepatic failure. Rituximab targets CD 20 receptors positive B cells. It can destroy both cancerous and normal B cells. A decline in immune function can activate occult HBV infection. Prior to initiation of rituximab therapy, screening should be conducted in all cases for HBV associated serological markers. Patients with active or occult HBV infection must be started on appropriate antiviral therapy to prevent any severe outcomes with rituximab-containing regimens.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nIn 1997, rituximab was approved for medical use and to treat non-Hodgkins B cell lymphomas.

It binds to CD 20 receptors on B cells, leading to the destruction of B cells including both the normal and cancerous cells [1]. It is especially used to treat diseases which have a high number of B cells or are characterized by abnormal B cells. By eliminating abnormal B cells, it allows the body to make normal and healthy B cells.\\xa0Normal B cells are rapidly depleted from the peripheral blood and remain depleted until nearly six months post-treatment, followed by a slow recovery [2].

After 11 months of complete remission (CR) following UCBT, the bone marrow showed 7.5% myeloblasts. CR was obtained after a single course of azacitidine monotherapy, but the myeloblasts gradually increased in the blood. We made a diagnosis of acute megakaryoblastic leukemia derived from donor cell with a fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of the sex chromosomes and an immunophenotypic analysis. Azacitidine was administered again and produced a therapeutic effect of stable disease. This case suggests that azacitidine may be a useful therapy for patients with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia in situations in which intensive chemotherapy and transplantation are not indicated.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nAcute megakaryoblastic leukemia has been described as a subtype of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) (1) and was incorporated into the French-American-British (FAB) classification of AML as M7 (2). The associated bone marrow characteristics include the proliferation of abnormal megakaryoblasts identified by the presence of platelet-specific surface glycoprotein and frequently extensive myelofibrosis. Histopathologic evidence of M7 AML itself is an independent poor prognostic factor for the overall survival (3).\\n\\nAzacitidine, a demethylation agent, has demonstrated a significant survival benefit in patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) relative to conventional care and has also been proved effective in older patients with newly diagnosed AML with >30% blasts (4,5). However, whether or not azacitidine is effective for acute megakaryoblastic leukemia is unclear, as it is rare in adults.\\n\\nNo reports are available on acute megakaryoblastic leukemia developing as donor cell leukemia (DCL) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and treatment with hypomethylating agents (azacitidine or decitabine). We herein report a case of acute megakaryoblastic leukemia developing as DCL after umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) that was treated with azacitidine.\\n\\nCase Report\\nA 64-year-old man had pancytopenia and was referred to our hospital (Table 1). An analysis of bone marrow aspirate revealed that myeloblasts comprised 49.5% of nucleated cells with multilineage dysplasia, so we made a diagnosis of AML with myelodysplasia-related changes. He achieved hematological complete remission (CR) after induction chemotherapy consisting of idarubicin and cytarabine and underwent UCBT with a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen from an unrelated female donor in first CR 8 months after the initial diagnosis.\\n\\nTable 1.

After L-ASP monotherapy, we re-examined the surface markers of the leukemic cells by FCM, which showed positivity for CD41, as well as CD7, CD21, CD33, CD34, CD38, CD56 and HLA-DR (Fig. 3).

Table 3 shows the main characteristics of the original leukemia and donor cell leukemia in our report. HSCT is an effective treatment for many hematologic malignancies, but disease relapse remains a major cause of post-transplant mortality (6). DCL is de novo leukemia developing in donor-derived hematopoietic precursor cells and is a rare but severe complication after allogeneic HSCT. The incidence of DCL may have been underestimated because clinicians do not perform thorough examinations to distinguish between recipient-derived cells and donor-derived cells in cases of leukemia developing after HSCT. DCL has become well known, and a number of reports of DCL have been published in recent years (7-9). It is important to distinguish DCL from relapse of original diseases when patients develop leukemia mimicking the original diseases after allogeneic HSCT, especially in cases where a decision regarding treatment for the leukemia must be made.\\n\\nTable 3.

Shiozaki et al. reported that the characteristics of DCL occurring after UCBT were different from those occurring after bone marrow transplantation (BMT), including the duration of time between transplantation and the occurrence of DCL, and the types of abnormal karyotypes (11). DCL occurred within a significantly shorter period after UCBT than after BMT, with a median duration of 14.5 months for UCBT and 36 months for BMT. The frequency of monosomy 7 observed in DCL after UCBT was significantly higher than that in DCL after BMT. Greaves reported that up to 5% of CB samples might harbor potentially pre-leukemic clones, raising the possibility that DCL might be disproportionately common after UCBT (12). It has been reported that risk factors for DCL include the use of cells obtained from elderly donors and cells obtained from cord blood (13). In our case, the use of cord blood for the cell source was a risk factor for developing DCL as well as for the early occurrence of DCL.\\n\\nAzacitidine may be effective for treating acute megakaryoblastic leukemia.

In the present N\\xa0=\\xa01 case we retrospectively have analysed lymphoma tissue by exome sequencing and global gene expression in a patient with unexpected long-term remission following relaps. The goals were to phenotype the diagnostic and relapsed lymphoma tissue and evaluate its pattern. Furthermore, to identify mutations available for targeted therapy and expression of genes to predict specific drug effects by resistance gene signatures (REGS) for R-CHOP as described at http://www.hemaclass.org. We expected that such a study could generate therapeutic information and a frame for future individual evaluation of molecular resistance detected at clinical relapse.\\n\\n\\nMETHODS\\nThe patient was diagnosed with a transformed high-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma stage III and treated with conventional R-CHOP [rituximab (R), cyclophosphamide (C), doxorubicin (H), vincristine (O) and prednisone (P)]. Unfortunately, she suffered from severe toxicity but recovered during the following 6 months\\' remission until biopsy-verified relapse.

It can evolve into the more aggressive histology of transformed FL (tFL) [3], resembling diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), but share a distinct gene expression profile and immunophenotype with the primary FL [4–8]. This transformation occurs by the expansion of one or more subclones with loss of the follicular growth pattern resulting in a rapidly progressive clinical course refractory to treatment and with inferior prognosis. To distinguish between progression and transformation of FL a biopsy for histological examination is needed in case of symptoms and CT verified tumor progression. The histological verified presence of both follicular and diffuse architecture in the initial diagnostic biopsy represents a finding that implies early transformation of FL [2, 3]. The survival post-transformation ranges between median 7–20\\xa0months [9, 10].\\n\\nSimilar to progression, the transformation is a clonal evolution from an ancestral clone that initially arises from a common normal cell of origin (COO) through linear or branched outgrowth of an existing subclone, deregulated by random genetic or epigenetic hits.\\n\\nOur knowledge of genetic aberrations in FL has dramatically increased over the last few years, and recent comprehensive studies by exome sequencing has identified the mutational landscape and the genetic changes that contribute to the step wise tumor progression, including transformation to DLBCL [4–8, 11–18].\\n\\nHere we report a unique, biopsy and histology verified case of primary tFL with relapse and long-term remission following palliation therapy.

Electron microscopy showed absence of dense bodies in platelets, which was consistent with a diagnosis of HPS. Following parental informed consent, we performed genetic screening using next-generation sequencing in a targeted gene panel analysis for primary immunodeficiency disease and/or IBD including HPS1, HPS4, and HPS6 genes (Additional file 1) [1, 4]. We identified 2 heterozygous mutations in the HPS1 gene in the patient (c.398\\u2009+\\u20095G\\u2009>\\u2009A and c.1323dupA) and a heterozygous mutation in each parent (father, c.398\\u2009+\\u20095G\\u2009>\\u2009A; mother, 1323dupA). These mutations have been reported previously in Japanese patients with HPS-1 [5]. We diagnosed the patient with HPS-1 resulting from compound heterozygous mutation of the HPS1 gene.\\n\\nDiscussion and conclusions\\nHPS can be caused by 10 different genotypes involving various chromosomes. These aberrant genes cause abnormal vesicle formation involving melanosomes, platelet dense bodies, and a subset of lysosomes. This results in visual impairment, skin hypopigmentation, and increased risk of bleeding [1, 3]. IBD has been reported in patients with HPS-1, −\\u20094, and\\u2009−\\u20096; the pathogenetic mechanisms are unknown [1, 2].\\n\\nIBD in HPS shows many of the same pathologic features as the more common Crohn’s colitis: irregular distribution of large bowel lesions, interspersed with regions of normal mucosal architecture; superficial crypt abscesses; and prominent inflammatory cell infiltrates in involved areas [2, 6, 7]. In a study of 122 subjects with HPS, 8% overall were found to have IBD; among those with gastrointestinal symptoms, 33% were diagnosed with IBD [2]. IBD in HPS can present at any age including early childhood but most commonly becomes evident in adolescence and young adulthood.

      "Predicting with title: Infantile-onset inflammatory bowel disease in a patient with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome: a case report., context: ['In some patients with HPS, conventional therapy of IBD including aminosalicylates and corticosteroids has been unsuccessful. Recent reports maintain that immunosuppressants and anti-tumor necrosis factor α therapy such as IFX may be effective for IBD in patients with HPS [2, 6, 7]. Use of compounds containing 5-aminosalicylic acid is an area of controversy because of the HPS platelet storage pool defect [1]. In fact, our patient is now in sustained clinical remission with colonic mucosal healing using only IFX.\\n\\nPatients with a diverse spectrum of rare genetic disorders can present with IBD, a situation referred to as monogenic IBD [4, 8, 9]. Patients with these disorders often develop symptoms during infancy or early childhood, along with endoscopic or histologic features of Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, or unclassified IBD. HPS is considered one of the monogenic IBDs [1, 2, 8]. Distinguishing monogenic forms among IBD patients under 6\\u2009years old can be crucial in determining the best treatment. Genetic screening using next-generation sequencing is a highly useful approach to diagnosis of patients with monogenic IBD [4, 8, 9]. In this patient, the clinical features of oculocutaneous albinism with nystagmus are consistent with an underlying diagnosis of HPS [1]. Such characteristic features may aid in diagnosing specific etiologies of infantile-onset IBD. Our patient represents a case in point; we diagnosed him with HPS-1 by genetic analysis as an infant and could treat him successfully with early introduction of IFX.\\n\\nIn conclusion, we consider our patient to be the first known HPS-1 patient with infantile-onset of IBD.

Among these cancers, non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 40–50% of cases that include LM.1, 2 In recent years, the incidence of LM in patients with NSCLC has increased, especially in EGFR+ NSCLC patients, and 9.0% of EGFR+ NSCLC patients were diagnosed with LM.3, 4, 5 Whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT), systemic chemotherapy, and intrathecal chemotherapy (ITCT) are the traditional treatment choices for NSCLC patients with LM. However, there is no consensus on the optimal treatment strategy, and the efficacies of these treatments for LM patients remain unsatisfactory. Presently, LM is still closely associated with a poor prognosis and rapid deterioration in clinical situations. Therefore, the goal of LM treatment is to improve or stabilize neurological symptoms, which can improve quality of life and lead to improved survival rates.'], hint: None\n",

There are several potential reasons for this phenomenon. Firstly, the survival of EGFR+ NSCLC patients has been significantly prolonged.6 Secondly, first (i.e. gefitinib) and second‐generation (afatinib) EGFR‐TKIs have poor penetration across the blood–brain barrier (BBB). The percentage of penetration ranges from 0.69% to 1.3%, which may provide a good opportunity for tumor cell growth in the CNS.7 Thirdly, as the treatment duration increases, the likelihood of the development of several secondary resistance mechanisms to EGFR‐TKIs also increases.8, 9, 10 Based on these considerations, the treatment options for EGFR+ NSCLC patients with LM generally include an intial high‐dose of first or second‐generation EGFR‐TKIs, or a switch to a different EGFR‐TKI.\\n\\n\\nEGFR mutations can be detected by analyzing circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in both plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which provides an alternative to tumor biopsies for further study.

This condition has been known by various names including phagadena gangrenosum, Meleney’s gangrene, Fournier’s gangrene (necrotising fasciitis of the perineum). The term necrotising fasciitis was first coined in 1952 by American Surgeon B Wilson.\\n\\nNecrotising fasciitis is classified into three types based on the organisms involved. Type I is polymicrobial, type II is monomicrobial and type III by a specific pathogen namely marine Vibrio species (V. vulnificus). Bacteria associated with type I are a combination of gram-positive cocci (streptococci and staphylococci), gram-negative species (Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas and Klebsiella) and anaerobic organisms like Bacteroides and Clostridia [1].\\n\\nNF is a rapidly progressing bacterial infection involving the subcutaneous tissues. The bacteria produce endotoxin and exotoxin [2] that leads to micro-vascular thrombosis [3], tissue ischaemia and liquefactive necrosis. This causes a systemic illness [4] often progressing to septic shock, multi-organ dysfunction and death. The condition is resistant to antimicrobial therapy due to poor drug penetration, hence leaving surgical debridement as the primary treatment option [5].'], hint: None\n",

Of these, type 2 diabetes is the commonest underlying medical condition and multiple needle punctures in IV drug users is the commonest trauma predisposing to NF [6].\\n\\nThe clinical picture and presentation of the patient may vary and hence can pose a diagnostic challenge at an early stage and hence requires a very high index of suspicion. The most common early signs are local erythema, warmth, induration, oedema and pain, which are also present in conditions like cellulitis and septic arthritis and hence the diagnostic dilemma. However, pain out of proportion to clinical signs associated with septic shock or failure to respond to broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics should alert the clinician to possible NF. Patches of skin necrosis, crepitus and bullae with compromised haemodynamic status are alarming signs.\\n\\nUltrasound, CT or MRI scan can be done in suspicious cases. Wong et al.

In previously described cases of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) associated with secondary ITP, treatment has consisted of nephrectomy, splenectomy, and corticosteroids. Here, we describe a case of metastatic RCC presenting with a right ventricular mass and subsequent development of secondary ITP. The clinical course was complicated by recurrent severe thrombocytopenia despite treatment with corticosteroids, rituximab, and thrombopoietin receptor agonists, precluding cancer-directed therapy and anticoagulation. Further study is needed to determine the optimal management strategy for malignancy-associated ITP.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nImmune thrombocytopenia (also referred to as immune thrombocytopenic purpura or ITP) is an autoimmune bleeding disorder characterized by isolated low platelet counts resulting from pathologic immune-mediated mechanisms. It occurs as a result of antibody-mediated targeting of platelet antigens in the setting of normal erythrocyte and leukocyte function without evidence of impaired bone marrow production. ITP is a common cause of thrombocytopenia in both children and adults, with an estimated incidence of 1.9–6.4 per 100,000 children/year and 1.6–3.9 per 100,000 adults/year [1]. Primary ITP is a diagnosis of exclusion, where no disorder or medication associated with thrombocytopenia is identified, whereas secondary ITP refers to thrombocytopenia attributable to an underlying disease or the development of drug-induced thrombocytopenia [2].\\n\\nAlthough secondary ITP is more commonly associated with rheumatologic disorders, infections, and hematologic malignancies, it is also seen in patients with solid tumor malignancies, with the highest reported cases in lung and breast cancers [3]. Approximately 20% of patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) experience some form of a paraneoplastic syndrome; however, secondary ITP associated with RCC is rare [4]. Removal of the primary tumor, corticosteroids, and splenectomy have been used to treat RCC-associated ITP with variable success [3]. Further, clinical data supporting effective therapies for patients with malignancy-associated ITP who are not surgical candidates is lacking. In this report, we describe a challenging case of secondary ITP in a patient with advanced RCC.\\n\\nCase Presentation\\nA 47-year-old female with a past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, depression, and tobacco use presented with chest pain and hemoptysis. Computed tomography (CT) angiogram revealed a large thrombus extending from the right ventricular (RV) cavity into the main pulmonary artery with additional bilateral segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli and evidence for right heart strain. Anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin was initiated, and the patient was transferred to a tertiary medical center for further management.'], hint: None\n",

She subsequently underwent intracardiac tumor resection, pulmonary artery embolectomy, and tricuspid valve ring repair. Surgical pathology demonstrated unorganized to early organizing thrombus with prominent clusters of highly atypical cells with enlarged nuclei and atypical mitotic figures. Immunohistochemistry was positive for pancytokeratin, PAX-8, and CD10. Overall, the findings were consistent with a cytologically high-grade, pleomorphic tumor favoring metastatic RCC. Follow-up TTE revealed continued moderate RV systolic dysfunction though significant decrease in the size and mobility of the RV mass. Her postoperative course was complicated by anemia and volume overload. She was transitioned from unfractionated heparin infusion to warfarin and aspirin prior to discharge.\\n\\nAbdominal CT scan obtained as an outpatient revealed a 9.9-cm left renal mass, multiple associated enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes, moderate pericardial effusion, nodular and peripheral wedge-shaped opacities in the lung bases concerning for metastatic disease or pulmonary infarcts, and small right greater than left pleural effusions with pleural thickening concerning for malignant effusions.\\n\\nShe was re-admitted after a syncopal event, and chest CT revealed multiple bilateral pulmonary emboli and a 5.5 × 3.0 cm RV mass with severely reduced RV function. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed multiple cortical 2–3 mm foci of enhancement involving the bilateral frontal lobes concerning for metastases. Abdominal MRI was notable for retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy and increasing size (10.1 × 7.6 × 10.8 cm; Fig. 1) of the left renal mass without evidence of invasion of surrounding organs. Anticoagulation was continued on admission given concern that the pulmonary emboli in part were related to bland thrombus formation in addition to tumor emboli. Further cardiac surgery, vascular surgical intervention, or nephrectomy were determined to be unsafe. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) was considered for the brain metastases but was deferred during the admission due to the small size of the lesions. She was discharged on anticoagulation with an outpatient plan for SRS and consideration for starting systemic therapy for advanced RCC.'], hint: None\n",

Anticoagulation was held and she was hospitalized for evaluation of the new-onset severe thrombocytopenia. Workup revealed negative heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)-PF4 antibody test, negative heparin-induced platelet aggregation assay, and normal ADAMTS13 activity. Peripheral blood smear revealed occasional schistocytes; however, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) was felt to be unlikely based on absence of clinical evidence for DIC and a normal fibrinogen level. Given concern for secondary ITP as a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with RCC, dexamethasone 40 mg daily was started for 4 days along with subcutaneous romiplostim (1 μg per kg weekly), a thrombopoietin mimetic used in treating ITP that stimulates bone marrow production of platelets by megakaryocytes [5].\\n\\nShe achieved a partial response with improvement in platelet count to 76 × 109/L after 4 days of dexamethasone and a single romiplostim treatment (Fig. 2). Severe thrombocytopenia recurred within 2 days of completion of dexamethasone. Prednisone 80 mg daily was started and the dose of romiplostim was increased to 3 μg/kg for the next dose (week 2 of treatment); and the platelet count stabilized at 55 × 109/L. The hospital course was complicated by development of a left upper extremity proximal deep vein thrombosis. Anticoagulation with low-dose enoxaparin 30 mg twice daily was initiated but was periodically held during the hospitalization for platelet counts less than 40 × 109/L. At discharge, enoxaparin was increased to 40 mg twice daily, romiplostim 4 μg/kg was administered, and prednisone was decreased to 60 mg daily. Outpatient plans were made to progressively increase romiplostim dosing and taper prednisone to maintain platelet counts high enough for anticoagulation without the need for steroids if possible, in order to receive systemic therapy for metastatic RCC.\\n\\nAt a 1-week follow-up appointment, the platelet count increased to 148 × 109/L. Enoxaparin was increased to 60 mg twice daily and prednisone dose taper was initiated. RCC-directed treatment was initiated with axitinib, a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, with plans to start pembrolizumab, a programmed death 1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, following SRS for brain metastases and completion of the prednisone taper. Ten days after starting axitinib, follow-up brain MRI prior to SRS demonstrated at least 15 new brain metastases. Whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) was planned instead of SRS, and axitinib was discontinued. Additionally, her platelet count decreased to 52 × 109/L with prednisone having been tapered to 10 mg daily while on weekly romiplostim (2 μg/kg). Prednisone was increased to 20 mg daily, and repeat platelet count the following week was further decreased to 23 × 109/L.

Abdominal/pelvic CT performed concurrently was notable for redemonstration of the large left renal mass with increased retroperitoneal adenopathy. Platelet count was further decreased to 15 × 109/L. She received intravenous fluids and methylprednisolone 125 mg and was admitted to the medical intensive care unit. Dexamethasone 40 mg daily was resumed and romiplostim 4 μg/kg was continued weekly. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was considered at this time but was deferred based on thrombogenic concerns.\\n\\nGiven severe thrombocytopenia precluding systemic therapy and enlargement of the RV tumor thrombus, palliative radiation therapy was planned for the heart and left kidney (30 Gy each) in addition to WBRT (35 Gy).

Standard initial therapy for primary ITP consists of corticosteroids (high-dose dexamethasone or prednisone), IVIG or IV anti-D immunoglobulin (anti-D), with combination treatment and platelet transfusions used for emergent bleeding [6]. While these initial therapies may produce a complete response (CR) as defined by platelet count ≥100 × 109/L and absence of bleeding [2], additional courses of corticosteroids for relapses are often necessary [6]. IVIG and anti-D are used as adjunctive treatments for patients without significant response to corticosteroids or as primary treatment for patients with a contraindication to corticosteroid use [6].'], hint: None\n",

The development of a Bullous pemphigoid (BP)-like blistering disease, driven by autoantibodies against the hemidesmosomal protein BP180, is a potentially serious irAE whose incidence seems to be increasing. We therefore set out to characterize the clinical and (immuno)histopathological features and treatment responses of cases of BP which developed during or after CI therapy collated in six German tertiary referral centers between 2014 and 2018. We identified twelve cases of BP which emerged during and/or after CI therapy. The time interval between the initiation of CI therapy and the diagnosis of BP was 3-74 weeks (median: 23 weeks). Age at the time of diagnosis of BP varied between 62 and 80 years (median: 76 years). The clinical presentation of the patients was diverse but the severity was relatively mild when compared to that seen in most cases of spontaneous BP. Only four patients met all of the immunopathological criteria recommended in the European guidelines for the diagnosis of BP. Topical corticosteroid treatment was sufficient to achieve disease control in most patients. CI therapy could be continued in 8 out of 12 patients. In summary, our study indicates that cases of BP during or after CI therapy bear several peculiarities distinguishing them from spontaneous BP. Given the diversity of the clinical presentation of CI-induced BP the application of existing diagnostic algorithms developed for spontaneous BP can be utilized to uncover the frequency and features of CI-induced BP and to develop and optimize management algorithms.\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nCheckpoint inhibitors (CIs) constitute a new class of immunomodulatory drugs which block co-inhibitory signals on immune effector cells and result in the generation of potent T-cell mediated immune responses. Among the CIs which are currently licensed are monoclonal antibodies which target the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) or the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) pathway. For example, the first-in-class drug ipilimumab inhibits CTLA-4, nivolumab and pembrolizumab inhibit PD-1, and atezolizumab and durvalumab target the PD-1 ligand PD-L1 (1). The advent of checkpoint inhibitors has revolutionized the treatment of solid cancers. Initially licensed for the treatment of metastatic melanoma, CIs are employed in an ever increasing number of cancer entities, including Merkel cell carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, urothelial bladder cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and Hodgkin’s lymphoma (1).'], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: Retrospective Analysis of Checkpoint Inhibitor Therapy-Associated Cases of Bullous Pemphigoid From Six German Dermatology Centers., context: ['Given that the CTLA-4 and PD-1 pathways play a central role in regulating cellular immune responses, removal of this control mechanism can result in both generalized and tissue-specific inflammation. These inflammatory responses are collectively termed “immune-related adverse events” (irAEs), and include, but are not limited to, dermatitis, colitis, hypophysitis, hepatitis, and nephritis (1). The skin is the most frequently affected organ, with up to 50% of patients receiving CIs developing skin-related irAEs.\\n\\nThe clinical presentation of cutaneous irAEs is remarkably diverse. Commonly presenting with a non-specific maculopapular rash accompanied by pruritus, they may also present with lichenoid, eczematous, granulomatous, lupus-like, or erythema multiforme-like skin changes and/or vitiligo (2).\\n\\nMost intriguingly, there is a growing body of literature which reports the development of the antibody-driven autoimmune disease bullous pemphigoid (BP), the most common disease of the group of pemphigoid diseases, in the context of treatment with immune CI (2–8).\\n\\nThe hallmark of BP is the development of autoimmunity against type XVII collagen (BP180) (9). BP presents clinically with the development of widespread urticarial plaques (pre-bullous phase), which evolve into blisters and erosions (10, 11). However, non-bullous and atypical variants of BP also exist. In these variants, patients exhibit localized blister formation with minimal or absent inflammation of the surrounding skin. Additionally, BP may present with predominantly eczematous (including dyshidrosiform) and subacute prurigo-like skin changes (12). Indeed, BP may exist in the absence of skin changes, with the only symptom being widespread, intractable itch. Given the wide spectrum of clinical symptoms and signs in BP, the disease can neither be reliably diagnosed nor excluded based on the clinical presentation alone. The European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) guidelines recommend that the diagnosis of BP should be based on both the clinical findings and (immuno)pathological investigations of the patient’s skin, both lesional and perilesional, and serum (12). Central to establishing the diagnosis of BP is the demonstration of linear depositions of autoantibodies, which are in most cases predominantly of the IgG immunoglobulin class, and/or of complement factor 3 (C3) at the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ) of perilesional skin (12). As the deposition of autoantibodies and/or complement at the DEJ is the defining feature of all pemphigoid diseases and as the clinical features of BP may overlap with those of other pemphigoid diseases, the clear distinction of pemphigoid diseases requires the detection of autoantibodies in the serum and a determination of their antigen specificity. This is achieved by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy on NaCl-split human skin, which detects the presence of autoantibodies against proteins of the dermal-epidermal junction, and by ELISA biochip-based techniques, and/or immunoblot assays to pinpoint th'], hint: None\n",

Serological examination alone is not sufficient to diagnose BP given that autoantibodies are reportedly undetectable in the serum of up to 20% of BP patients, but are present in the serum of 0.5% of healthy individuals (12, 13). Histopathologically, an early blister exhibits a subepidermal cleft combined with a dense dermal inflammatory infiltrate mainly consisting of eosinophils and neutrophils. However, the histopathological examination is also non-specific and is therefore not suitable alone to confirm the diagnosis (14).\\n\\nThe complexity and heterogeneity of both BP and cutaneous irAEs means that a comprehensive clinical, serological, and (immuno)histopathological work-up is central to correctly diagnosing suspected cases of BP during or after CI therapy.

HCQ retinopathy can accompany other retinal complications such as cystoid macular edema (CME) and epiretinal membrane [1]. Specifically, CME is the result of fluid accumulation in the outer plexiform layer in the macular area and leads to central visual loss.\\n\\nSeveral treatment modalities have been shown to be effective for CME combined with other retinal diseases. In eyes with combined CME and retinitis pigmentosa, treatment with oral or topical acetazolamide can produce successful resolution of CME and functional improvement according to previous studies [2–7]. Although the pathogenic mechanism of CME in HCQ retinopathy has not been elucidated, oral or topical acetazolamide may also be useful in the treatment of CME in HCQ retinopathy. Here, we report a case of CME in HCQ retinopathy that improved with the use of oral acetazolamide.

      "Predicting with title: The effect of oral acetazolamide on cystoid macular edema in hydroxychloroquine retinopathy: a case report., context: ['After treatment with oral acetazolamide for one month, CME was resolved in both eyes on SD-OCT images (Fig. 2). CMT was decreased from 245 to 177\\xa0μm and from 335 to 146\\xa0μm in the right and left eyes, respectively. BCVA was improved to 20/25 in both eyes. Follow-up FA showed decreased dye leakage in both the macular and mid-peripheral areas (Fig. 3).\\n\\nDiscussion\\nHCQ retinopathy presents with initial photoreceptor damage in a classic parafoveal distribution, known as a “bull’s eye” pattern, which corresponds to parafoveal scotomas upon visual field examination [8, 9] and parafoveal thinning of the outer nuclear layer with breakup of the ellipsoid zone and interdigitation zone lines on SD-OCT. [10] However, recent studies have shown that the initial pattern of damage in Asian eyes is more frequently in the more peripheral extramacular area near the arcades, as a pericentral pattern [11, 12]. In this pattern of retinopathy, CME may threaten relatively preserved central vision, leading to deterioration of visual function.\\n\\nCME can develop in various retinal disorders [13]. Macular edema associated with chloroquine (CQ) retinopathy is relatively rare, and it was reported in 5 of 78 patients during a study period from 1957 to 1979 [14]; however, its treatment has not been discussed extensively. Although some cellular and molecular factors have been elucidated, the precise mechanisms for the formation of CME are unknown, including for HCQ retinopathy. In retinitis pigmentosa, CME formation has been suggested to involve breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier (BRB) as a result of chronic, low-grade inflammation [15–21] and decreased fluid transport efficiency of the retinal pigment epithelium [3]. CME associated with HCQ retinopathy has been reported in both leaking [22] and non-leaking [23] forms. In this case, it can be assumed that the leaking form of CME occurred owing to a mechanism such as BRB breakdown due to HCQ damage and that CME developed because such damage was not recovered even after the drug was cut off; however, the precise mechanism should be revealed in future studies.\\n\\nIn the present case, the CME associated with HCQ retinopathy exhibited diffuse leakage on FA that resolved with oral acetazolamide as evidenced by decreased fluorescein leakage. Acetazolamide reduces macular edema and improves visual acuity in some patients with macular edema related to certain inflammatory and degenerative eye diseases, including chronic iridocyclitis and retinitis pigmentosa [4]. With respect to mechanism, acetazolamide has been suggested to stimulate outward active transport and passive permeability across the BRB [6, 24, 25]. More specifically, acetazolamide blocks the active transport of certain ions (HCO3-, Cl-) across the retinal pigment epithelium [26], and also hastens the rate of resorption of subretinal fluid [27]. In our patient, acetazolamide was thought to induce functional recovery of the BRB, leading to a reduction in diffuse leakage and also improvement of CME.'], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: The effect of oral acetazolamide on cystoid macular edema in hydroxychloroquine retinopathy: a case report., context: [\"Use of topical dorzolamide or oral acetazolamide (250\\xa0mg/day) in patients with CME in HCQ retinopathy has been described in only one recent study [1], which reported limited benefit. However, the patients in that study also had epiretinal membrane, which may have limited the beneficial effects of acetazolamide on reducing macular edema. Aside from carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, other treatment options for CME with HCQ retinopathy such as triamcinolone or anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibodies have not been described in the literature. In our case, there were no accompanying structural alterations to the central macular area such as epiretinal membrane, which likely explains why acetazolamide was effective for anatomic and functional improvement of CME.\\n\\nRetinitis pigmentosa associated with various types of mutations shows similar features to advanced HCQ retinopathy; therefore, retinitis pigmentosa should be carefully assessed for the differential diagnosis in patients taking HCQ medication. In the present case, the patient reported no family history of eye diseases and no visual symptoms before the initiation of HCQ therapy and she had no auditory symptoms. Genetic analyses on the associated mutations might be helpful for ruling out the possibilities of retinitis pigmentosa; however, we believe that the baseline (at the time of HCQ initiation) full-field electroretinography (ERG) and/or multifocal ERG may be very suggestive for the differential diagnosis.\\n\\nConclusion\\nIn conclusion, this case suggests that oral acetazolamide is an effective treatment for CME associated with HCQ retinopathy.

Severe ocular complications appear in less than 1% of the patients and require early treatment. We present the case of a patient diagnosed with a BRAF mutated metastatic melanoma. Ocular pain and a blurred vision appeared after treatment and the patient visited the ophthalmology emergency room, where he was diagnosed with acute anterior uveitis (AAU), synechiae, and bilateral papillitis. The patient was treated with topical corticosteroids, prednisone, and mydriatics, which immediately improved the patient's status. Therefore, when an ocular inflammatory disease exists, immune checkpoint inhibitor treatments must be ruled out as possible causes.\\n\\nPembrolizumab is a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody that is selective against the PD-1 receptor on the cell surface. It is used in the treatment of unresectable metastatic melanomas. The response rate of this treatment is about 40%.[1] Although the frequency of adverse effects is high, in majority of the cases these are mild and easily treated.[23] These side effects are known as immune-related adverse events because they are caused by the lack of inhibition of T lymphocytes.\\n\\nOcular complications appear in less than 1% of the patients and are severe and require early treatment.[1]\\n\\nCase Report\\nA 38-year-old male, Caucasian, diagnosed with a BRAF-mutant melanoma with locoregional recurrence, a satellite nodule, and adenopathies. Treatment with pembrolizumab was initiated. After 6 cycles of treatment, the patient began to experience ocular pain and blurred vision for which he visited the ophthalmology emergency room of the hospital, where he was diagnosed with AAU with synechiae and bilateral papillitis. He had a visual acuity (VA) of 20/20, Tyndall +++ in the right eye (OD) and Tyndall++++ in the left eye (OS) with multiple inferior iridocrystalline synechiae in both eyes (OU) and no hypopyon. Edema of the bilateral papilla without vitritis was observed in the fundoscopy [Fig. 1]. Treatment with dexamethasone eye drops and 40 mg of prednisone every 24 hours was initiated in the emergency room. Cyclopentolate, tropicamide, and phenylephrine eye drops were also prescribed to break the synechiae. The examination after 24 hours revealed Tyndall++ in OD and Tyndall + in OS and no synechiae were found. There was an improvement of the bilateral papillitis. The oncologist in charge of the patient and an ophthalmologist expert in uveitis considered the pembrolizumab to be the primary cause of ocular inflammation since the mechanism of action of the drug can induce ocular inflammation and there are similar cases reported in the literature.

An optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the layer of the nerve fibers was performed to assess the edema [Fig. 2].

To avoid activating the immune system, T cells have receptors that inhibit activation. Two of these receptors are CTLA-4 and PD-1. The metastatic cells of the melanoma are capable of expressing ligands for these receptors and hence, inhibit the activation of the immune system. Ipilimumab was the first of this family of drugs known as an immune checkpoint inhibitor, which acts by inhibiting the ligands of the CTLA-4 tumor cells and therefore T cells proliferate, invade the tumor cells, and help in the process of regression. Pembrolizumab acts in the same way but on PD-1 ligands.[6]\\n\\nThe mechanism that explains the development of ocular inflammation during the use of pembrolizumab is as follows: The presence of PD-1 ligand in ocular cells has been demonstrated and it is believed that the expression of these PD-1 ligands mediates in the ocular inflammation by inhibiting the proinflammatory cytokines produced by T cells. Thus, it is believed that the presence of PD-1 inhibitors can contribute to the development of ocular inflammation.[1]'], hint: None\n",

Approximately 50\\u2009% of patients with CAR present with visual symptoms before the diagnosis of a malignancy is made [3].

The treatment of CAR is often challenging. Treatment of the underlying malignancy alone does not alter the course of the ocular disease. Various treatment modalities have been tried in patients with CAR, including oral and intravenous steroids, plasmapheresis, IVIg, rituximab, azathioprine, cyclosporine, and mycophenolate mofetil [2, 6–8]. Despite treatment with these systemic medications, it is not unusual to have a progressive decline in vision with this disease. Our patient responded initially to systemic steroids but did not have an alteration of his disease course with mycophenolate mofetil or IVIg. After initiation of IVTA injections, his vision improved. Vision improvement in CAR is unusual; vision stabilization is often the best that can be hoped for. In this patient, there was strong evidence for a causal relationship between the injections and visual improvement. When the intravitreal triamcinolone wore off, his vision declined. With his initial injections, the improvement in vision could be attributed, at least in part, to treatment of the CME. But subsequent injections were given when there were no retinal cystic changes or thickening present on OCT and yet reinjection led to marked subjective and objective improvement. The improvement was likely due to suppression of inflammation around the photoreceptors as evidenced by restoration of inner segment/outer segment junction and resolution of hyperreflective lesions along the photoreceptor layer on OCT after the injections.

There is one case report of retinal periphlebitis associated with CAR in a patient with ovarian cancer [9]. In the presence of CME, intravitreal steroids have previously been shown to be effective in patients with npAIR [2]. The unique presentation of CAR with CME and vasculitis in our patient motivated the use of intraocular triamcinolone, but there was evidence for an effect on the course of CAR directly given the visual improvements even when IVTA injected in the absence of CME. The presence of anti-retinal antibodies in the sera of patients with CAR suggests the need for systemic intervention in general, but this patient’s course suggests that a subset of CAR patients might be successfully treated with local therapy. The OCT photoreceptor findings in this patient pre- and post-injection indicate that intravitreal steroids may be able to successfully suppress inflammation and apoptosis induced by the autoantibodies at the level of the photoreceptors despite ongoing systemic production and/or circulation of antibodies. Some authors caution that readministration of intravitreal steroid for recurrent CME in npAIR and CAR is best done early when cystic changes are just starting to recur to avoid cycles of retinal cyst expansion and collapse which may cause retinal damage [2, 10]. Similarly, CAR patients without CME being treated with intravitreal steroids should be followed closely with OCT imaging and retreated promptly when evidence of photoreceptor layer disruption becomes apparent to avoid permanent photoreceptor damage.\\n\\nIn summary, intravitreal steroids should be considered in patients with CAR who do not respond to systemic therapy.

Patients with severe mental illness have a higher risk of developing the condition compared to the general population. Methods: We observed 10 cases of VTE in patients with mental illness who were treated with the antipsychotic drug olanzapine. The diagnosis of VTE was made at the University Hospital Hradec Kralove (UH HK) from 2004 to 2013. VTE was objectively determined by imaging techniques (duplex ultrasonography, CT angiography) and laboratory tests (D-dimer). The average age was 46 years. The clinical manifestation of VTE was deep vein thrombosis in nine cases, including one case of simultaneous pulmonary embolism and one case of a concurrent ischemic cerebrovascular accident (iCVA). None of our patients had a history of malignant disease, trauma, or surgery. Results: Apart from antipsychotic medication, all the patients had clinical or laboratory risk factors for VTE. The most frequent clinical risk factors were obesity (n = 7) and smoking (n = 6). The most frequent laboratory risk factors were increased levels of FVIII (n = 4), mild hyperhomocysteinemia (n = 3), and factor V Leiden mutation (n = 2). VTE developed within 3 months after antipsychotic drug initiation in three patients and within 6 months in three patients. Conclusion: Olanzapine can be considered a precipitating factor for VTE formation. When olanzapine is administered, we need to monitor for clinical signs and symptoms of VTE, especially when other risk factors are present.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nVenous thromboembolism (VTE) is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition. Manifestations of VTE include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). VTE is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Considerable amounts of money are also spent on the treatment of VTE in the developed countries of Europe and North America. VTE affects approximately 1.0–1.8 people per 1,000 annually (1, 2). The incidence rises exponentially with age, and the risk significantly increases in people over the age of 40 years (3). Multiple risk factors are involved in the development of VTE. VTE risk factors can be divided into physiological and pathophysiological, clinical and laboratory, and congenital and acquired factors (\\nTable 1\\n) (1, 2, 4).\\n\\nTable 1 Risk factors for VTE [adapted from Refs.

The risk of thrombosis rises significantly when multiple factors occur together. In older patients, acquired risk factors occur more frequently, which explains the significantly increased incidence of VTE in the elderly population.\\n\\nThe pathophysiological mechanism underlying VTE formation is the development of a relative thrombophilic state. This involves a shift in the hemostatic system towards thrombosis. If a genetic disposition is prominent in the etiopathogenesis of VTE, patients are determined to have hereditary thrombophilia. If external risk factors prevail, the condition is determined to be an acquired hypercoagulable state. A hypercoagulable state may result from the presence of any of the conditions belonging to the so-called Virchow triad (venous stasis, hypercoagulability, and vessel wall damage) (1, 2).\\n\\nIn patients with a mental illness, the risk of VTE is increased for several reasons. In a previous study, we found significantly increased activation of markers of thrombogenesis (sP-selectin, D-dimer, FVIII) in untreated patients experiencing a first episode of psychosis compared to healthy volunteers (5). The markers of thrombogenesis continued to be elevated after 1 year of treatment (6). Antiphospholipid antibodies (APAs), especially anticardiolipin antibodies (ACLAs), may serve as a marker of autoimmune reactivity, or they may directly interfere with phospholipid metabolism in schizophrenia patients. They may also have prothrombogenic effects. Inflammatory markers are also elevated during acute psychosis, which may lead to an increased risk of pathological blood coagulation (7). Hyperhomocysteinemia, which is also a risk factor for VTE, can occur in patients with mental disorders who also smoke, have poor dietary habits, and consume excessive amounts of coffee\\n\\nAntipsychotic medications are another risk factor for VTE in patients with a psychotic disease (8). Antipsychotic drugs contribute to the development of a hypercoagulable state through several potential mechanisms, including drug-induced sedation, obesity, hyperprolactinemia, increased platelet aggregation, and elevation of APA (5, 9).'], hint: None\n",

The highest risk of VTE emerges during the first 3 months after initiation of antipsychotic treatment (12). Other studies found the highest risk in the first month after the initiation of an antipsychotic (13, 14). In addition to the time period following drug administration and the antipsychotic drug class used, other risk factors include using higher drug doses, using a combination of several antipsychotic drugs, and parenteral administration of antipsychotic agents (15).\\n\\nThrough a long-term project named ANTRE (ANTipsychotics, ThRombosis, Embolism) involving interdisciplinary cooperation within the University Hospital in Hradec Kralove, we have been aiming to develop a comprehensive approach to the issue of VTE in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Cases of VTE development are carefully recorded. In addition to isolated case reports of VTE development during treatment with different antipsychotic agents, we recorded 10 cases involving the administration of olanzapine.\\n\\nPatients and Methods\\nThe patient group consisted of a total of 10 patients (women n = 3) who were treated with olanzapine. VTE occurrence was monitored prospectively between 2004 and 2013 in a specialized outpatient unit for VTE treatment. The average age of the patients was 46 years, with a range of 17 to 71 years. Three patients had a diagnosis of delusional disorder, two had paranoid schizophrenia, and two had bipolar disorder. The other patient diagnoses were an addiction to multiple narcotic drugs, behavioral disorder related to pregnancy and puerperium, and mental retardation with a behavioral disorder. The duration of psychiatric illness prior to the occurrence of VTE was determined. We also determined the duration and dose of olanzapine utilized prior to VTE and recorded other psychotropic drugs taken concomitantly. Information was collected from patient-reported history, the hospital information system, and reports by attending outpatient psychiatrists. None of the patients had previously suffered from VTE. Patient history was used to determine if there was a family history (FH) of VTE. In the patient group, VTE occurred either during hospitalization or during outpatient care. VTE diagnosis and subsequent treatment were conducted by an internist. If clinical symptoms suggested VTE, then additional examinations were conducted. In all cases, VTE was verified using imaging techniques (duplex ultrasonography, CT angiography) and laboratory methods (D-dimer). Blood tests were used to detect laboratory risk factors.

In one patient, VTE manifested clinically as neurological symptoms without symptoms of DVT. These atypical symptoms were due to a paradoxical embolization in the setting of a heart malformation, patent foramen ovale. Clinical or laboratory risk factors for VTE development were present in all the patients. The most frequent clinical risk factors were obesity (n = 7) and smoking (n = 6). The most frequent laboratory risk factors were elevated FVIII level (n = 4) and mild homocysteinemia (HCY) (n = 3). In these patients, mild HCY was always present together with elevated FVIII level.

It is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. In clinical practice, the spectrum of its use is much wider. Off-label indications include psychotic disorders of various etiologies (toxic and organic), behavioral disorders in patients with dementia, eating disorders, and personality disorders. The relatively high incidence of olanzapine-related VTE may be distorted by the high number of patients treated with this antipsychotic agent.\\n\\nA possible prothrombogenic mechanism of olanzapine at the molecular level is an affinity for 5-HT2A serotonin receptors. Blocking these receptors results in increased platelet aggregation and increased blood coagulability (16). Blockade of α1 adrenergic receptors by olanzapine may cause hypotension and thereby venous stasis in the lower limbs. Another mechanism may be olanzapine-induced production of the antiphospholipid antibodies: lupus anticoagulant (LA) and ACLAs (17). Increasing these APA titers is associated with a prothrombogenic state (18). Olanzapine may also induce a temporary increase in prolactin levels early in the course of treatment. Hyperprolactinemia correlates with increased levels of P-selectin, a platelet activation marker (19).\\n\\nMetabolic symptoms caused by olanzapine represent an indirect mechanism for VTE development. The prothrombogenic metabolic symptoms that often occur during olanzapine treatment include hyperglycemia, hyperleptinemia, dyslipidemia, and weight gain (20). Weight gain is mainly due to the blockade of H1 histamine and 5-HT2C serotonin receptors by olanzapine.\\n\\nObesity [body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30)] is associated with an up to two-fold increase in the risk of VTE development. Obese patients have reduced fibrinolytic activity and capacity. Higher levels of the procoagulation factors FVIII and FIX also occur (21). Central obesity is also accompanied by a procoagulant and hypofibrinolytic state related to inflammation, oxidative stress, dyslipidemia, and ectopic fat deposition (22). In our group, obesity was identified in seven patients. The patients’ body weight increased significantly during olanzapine treatment.'], hint: None\n",

We describe a 54-year-old woman with history of stage IIIa breast cancer, receiving adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. The chemotherapy was administered through a Poweport® device, the position of which was confirmed with fluoroscopy and function confirmed by flushing the line. Urgent intervention was required as patient was symptomatic and experienced severe right-sided pleuritic chest pain. Radiology also confirmed the extravasation of doxorubicin into the pleural space. Surgical washout of the pleural space and 3 days therapy with i.v. dexrazoxane were carried out to prevent tissue damage and long-term sequelae. Use of dexrazoxane should always be considered following intra-pleural extravasation because of its potential efficacy and reasonable tolerability. However, the best approach to extravasation injury is prevention by systematic implementation of careful, standardized, evidence-based administration techniques.\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\nAnthracycline extravasation is a feared complication of intravenous (i.v.) chemotherapy due to the tissue toxicity of this group of drugs. The reported incidence of the chemotherapy extravasation in the literature varies from 0.01% to 6% [1, 2]. However extravasation into thorax is rare, so far only 10 cases have been reported [1, 3]. A retrospective single centre study showed that improvement in staff training reduced the incidence of this complication by a factor of 10 (0.1–0.001%) over 15 years.\\n\\nVesicant injuries can progress within hours or days, resulting in lasting tissue injury and necrosis. Management is considered an emergency requiring combination of medical and surgical care.\\n\\nManagement of dermal extravasation is well established often requiring reconstructive surgical repair and use of DMSO which is a topical agent [2]. The effects of these agents into pleural or lung tissue are not well defined and there are no standard approaches in the management of accidental intra-pleural extravasation.\\n\\nOur case report describes a 54-year-old female who presented with intra-pleural extravasation of doxorubicin from a malpositioned central venous catheter. Management consisted of urgent surgical intervention and dexrazoxane, which proved to be effective in the long run.\\n\\nCASE REPORT\\nA 54-year-old woman (Mrs XY) was transferred from another facility for management of iatrogenic infusion of doxorubicin into the pleural space through a migrated central venous catheter.\\n\\nHer only medical history was stage IIIA left breast cancer oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive.

      "Predicting with title: Management of anthracycline extravasation into the pleural space., context: ['Adjuvant chemotherapy was recommended following review of histopathology. Prior to the first cycle of chemotherapy, long-term central venous access was established using a Poweport® device. This was inserted through the right subclavian vein using Seldinger technique and no complications were noted at time of procedure. The line position was confirmed with fluoroscopy and function confirmed by flushing the line (see Fig. 1).\\nFigure 1: Position of the line confirmed with fluoroscopy and function confirmed by flushing the line\\n\\n\\n\\nRoutine chest X-ray following procedure demonstrated correct catheter position with no complications.\\n\\nThe first cycle of chemotherapy consisting of 85 mg of i.v. doxorubicin (60 mg/m2) in 50 ml of normal saline and 850 mg of cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2) was given 5 days post-insertion of the port. Prior to the administration of the cytotoxic agents, it was noted that there was no withdrawal of blood from the port on aspiration. Doxorubicin infusion was commenced by nurses as they were able to infuse a flush solution without resistance. Following 6 ml (10 mg) of infused doxorubicin, Mrs XY complained of severe right-sided pleuritic chest pain. Fluoroscopy contrast study demonstrated that central venous catheter had curled unusually, causing perforation of superior vena cava or the azygos vein and migrated into the pleural space (see Fig. 2).\\nFigure 2: Fluoroscopy contrast study showing contrast medium flowed over the surface of the lung in the pleural cavity. The Port-A-Cath tubing tip is now in the pleural cavity.\\n\\n\\n\\nMrs XY was transferred to our institution for urgent surgical washout of the pleural space and i.v. dexrazoxane. She received i.v. dexrazoxane within 6 hours of extravasation. A dose of 1000 mg/m2 was used, administered immediately before the operation followed by 500 mg/m2 daily for 2 days post-operatively.\\n\\nA right thoracoscopic-assisted pleural lavage was performed the same day. The tip of the central catheter was visually identified lodged in the pleural space but there was no frank pneumonitis or direct parenchymal injury to the lung. The catheter was not broken and sutures were found to be intact. It is unclear as to the circumstances that led to the catheter migration to this unusual position.\\n\\nThree chest drains (2\\xa0×\\xa028Fr Mallinckrodt® catheters through port sites and 1\\xa0×\\xa012Fr Arrow® catheter into the axilla) were left in-situ for the purpose of administering 24 hours of ongoing saline infusion (see Fig. 3).\\nFigure 3: Chest drain inserted for continuous irrigation post-procedure\\n\\n\\n\\nPost-operatively Mrs XY recovered well. Drains were sequentially removed by post-operative day 5.

Taken at 1 month after the incident.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe completed her adjuvant chemotherapy through a PICC line in 2015. Regular outpatient follow-up assured that Mrs XY is doing well and a repeat chest X-ray, taken 10 months after extravasation, only revealed small pleural effusion (see Fig. 5).\\nFigure 5: Repeat chest X-ray taken 10 months after extravasation again showing right pleural effusion without any other abnormalities\\n\\n\\n\\nDISCUSSION\\nThe anthracyclines (daunorubicin, idarubicin, epirubicin and doxorubicin) are widely utilized in the treatment of solid tumours and haematological malignancies.\\n\\nAnthracycline extravasation is a highly feared local complication of i.v. administration. Compared with other types of injectable anti-tumour drugs, anthracyclines have the potential to cause the most damage or complications because of their mechanism of action on tissue when they extravasate. Anthracyclines bind to the nucleic acids in the DNA of healthy tissues when they leak out of a vein. This process causes cell death and continues to do so as more drug is released into the surrounding tissue. These injuries can become larger, deeper and more painful as the cycle repeats itself [2].\\n\\nCentral venous catheters are frequently used for infusion of vesicant drugs as they provide reliable venous access, high-flow rates and rapid drug dilution. Unfortunately, they may also involve complications, including drug extravasation.\\n\\nImplementation of proper guidelines regarding use of venous catheters for chemotherapy can minimize or prevent complications. Location of the catheter tip should be in high-flow vessels to prevent cytostatic accumulation, which may lead to catheter thrombosis and vessel wall perforation [1]. Prior to anthracycline administration, it is critical to ensure port or peripheral catheter patency and position radiographically. Furthermore, it is necessary to reconfirm the positioning of the catheter when it is not possible to draw blood or infuse a flush solution prior to start of the chemotherapy infusion [4]. In this case, by means of brief aspiration of blood before giving anthracycline, followed by flushing of sodium chloride or glucose solution may have resulted in the detection of the catheter displacement.\\n\\nIndications of extravasation include symptoms of pain or fever. Lab investigations most frequently reveal leucocytosis. Radiology, most preferably CT scan, should be used for diagnosis of extravasation [1, 3, 4].'], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: Management of anthracycline extravasation into the pleural space., context: ['Immediate discontinuation of the infusion and aspiration of as much solution as possible through the central venous catheter must be done in all cases of extravasation [3]. Identification of local extravasation and surgical intervention wherever feasible to remove as much of the agent as possible [3] and at the same time administering dexrazoxane must be instituted to prevent major complications [4].\\n\\nBefore the approval of dexrazoxane for anthracycline extravasation, topical DMSO, ice application and/or use of steroids were recommended as a plausible approach. In the review of intrathoracic extravasation of chemotherapeutic agents from implanted ports by Bozkurt et al., anthracycline extravasation was reported in two cases and one case was in combination with five fluorouracil. Most of the patients developed pleural effusion like our Mrs. XY or pericardial effusion. Management consisted of aspiration of the residual drug as much as possible before removing the catheter, flushing of the cavities with normal saline and/or systemic administration of steroids. Surprisingly, all of them had a favourable outcome [3].\\n\\nIn 2007, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved dexrazoxane for injection for the treatment of extravasation resulting from i.v. anthracycline chemotherapy [5]. Dexrazoxane acts as a reversible topoisomerase II inhibitor and ring chelating agent, thereby reducing the formation of anthracycline–iron complexes, which are toxic to surrounding tissue [2, 4].\\n\\nIn Europe, two prospective clinical studies of the efficacy of dexrazoxane (TT01 and TT02) in preventing the potentially devastating effects of biopsy-proven anthracycline extravasation in the skin demonstrated that dexrazoxane treatment is highly effective both on a short and long-term basis. Epirubicin was involved in 56% of the cases, 41% were treated with doxorubicin while two received daunorubicin. Four out of 57 had extravasation involving central venous access device and none of them required surgical intervention. The 3 day treatment schedule with dexrazoxane consisting of a daily dose of 1000 mg/m2 on days 1–2 and 500 mg/m2 on day 3 proved effective in preventing surgery-requiring necrosis. Haematological toxicities and transient elevation of liver enzymes associated with dexrazoxane were manageable [2, 6].\\n\\nSince FDA approval of dexrazoxane, subsequent clinical case reports have supported the above-mentioned study findings, and the systemic antidotal treatment has shown value in anthracycline extravasation. Promising results were obtained from a 2007 to 2010 Belgian survey involving 41 patients treated with dexrazoxane from 29 centres. It showed that surgical debridement due to anthracycline extravasation could be avoided in 95.1% of cases (39/41 extravasations) with use of dexrazoxane with manageable toxicities reported in only 8/41 cases [2].'], hint: None\n",

[4] regarding the evolution and management of intra-pleural extravasation through a CVAD using dexrazoxane resulting in a favourable long-term outcome with similar strategy.\\n\\nIn conclusion, prevention is the best approach for managing chemotherapy extravasation. Prior to using venous catheters, their position and function should be adequately checked, with adherence to surgical and oncological procedures. Anthracyclines should be administered as a short infusion only in the presence of healthcare professionals with oncology training.\\n\\nA prospective clinical trial involving the use of dexrazoxane in intra-pleural extravasation is unlikely. Therefore, the use of dexrazoxane in intrathoracic extravasation depends on reports of individual cases and its access, keeping in mind the financial toxicities.\\n\\nUse of dexrazoxane due to its potential benefits and relatively mild side effects along with urgent thoracic intervention should always be considered following intra-pleural extravasation [4].\\n\\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\\n1.

Introduction\\nCrimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is an arthropod-borne viral infection that infects domestic and wild animals and can be transmitted to humans via several routes. The causative agent of CCHF is an RNA virus of the genus Nairovirus belonging to the Bunyaviridae family of viruses (1). Over several decades, serious outbreaks with high case-fatality rates have been reported from different parts of the world, including the Middle East (2-6). CCHF is becoming a global problem, and more cases are expected to be diagnosed as the disease becomes endemic to more areas due to movement of livestock, changes in hunting activities and agricultural practices (7). A real threat exists to health care workers managing patients with CCHF and causing nosocomial outbreaks, which may have high fatality rates (8). Another concern is related to the potential use of the virus as a weapon of bioterrorism, given the limited availability of diagnostic laboratory services with Biosafety Level 4 facilities (9).\\n\\nCCHF is not endemic to UAE; however, two documented limited outbreaks occurred in 1979 and 1994 and were associated with high mortality rates among infected health care workers (10, 11).

One explanation could be a lower viral load from a direct tick bite in cases of community-acquired infection.\\t\\n\\nPhase 4\\n\\tConvalescent phase usually begins 15 - 20 days after disease onset in patients who survive the hemorrhagic phase.

Regionally, the disease has been reported in Oman, KSA, Kuwait, Iran, Pakistan, India, and Iraq (13-24). In nonendemic Gulf countries, the risk of acquiring human infection is mostly related to imported livestock that carry infected ticks. The risk seems to be greatest during Hajj season, when hundreds of thousands of cattle are imported to the region for the ceremonial sacrifice.\\n\\nFollowing initial infection by tick bite or contact with body fluids of an infected animal or human, four different phases of illness are recognized, as described first by Hoogstraal in 1979 and subsequently by others (25-28).

Epidermal necrolysis spectrum eruptions such as Stevens–Johnson Syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are considered a continuum and share the same pathogenesis. They are only differentiated on the body surface area by epidermal detachment [2]. Epidermal detachment of\\u2009<\\u200910%, 10–30% and\\u2009>\\u200930% are designated as SJS, SJS/TEN and TEN, respectively [2, 3]. The mortality rate ranges from 1 to 5% for SJS, and 25 to 35% for TEN [2].\\n\\nSJS and TEN are rare severe cutaneous reactions with annual incidences of 1.2–6 and 0.4–1.2 per million people, respectively [4, 5]. The common cause of SJS/TEN is drug exposure, while infections, contrast media, and vaccinations are mainly linked to SJS. Drugs commonly associated with the development of SJS/TEN include cotrimoxazole, nevirapine, allopurinol, sulfasalazine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, lamotrigine, and carbamazepine [1]. The estimated incidence of cutaneous adverse drug reactions (CADRs) to psychotropic medications among psychiatric inpatients is 2–5% [6]. Lange-Asschenfeldt et al. observed that antiepileptic drug (AED) mood stabilizers accounted for the highest CADR rate as a drug group, followed by antidepressants, while antipsychotics were the least commonly involved medications in CADRs [6]. Psychotropics with a high risk of epidermal necrolysis are carbamazepine, lamotrigine and phenobarbital [3]. Recent studies have also reported on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)-induced epidermal necrolysis, and have implicated fluoxetine, paroxetine, fluvoxamine and mirtazapine [7–11]. There is no documentation of epidermal necrosis with concurrent administration of an SSRI and carbamazepine; therefore, we present a patient with bipolar affective disorder who developed SJS following consecutive administration of fluoxetine and carbamazepine.\\n\\nCase Presentation\\nA 29-year-old Black female patient was admitted to the psychiatric unit with a 2-day history of disorganised behaviour, selective mutism, paranoid delusions, and auditory and visual hallucinations.

      "Predicting with title: An Interesting Case of Carbamazepine-Induced Stevens-Johnson Syndrome., context: ['Carbamazepine is a well-known causative agent of drug-induced SJS among psychotropics [3]. Rare cases of SSRI-induced epidermal necrolysis, i.e. SJS and TEN, have been described in the literature [7–11]. To our knowledge, no cases of epidermal necrolysis have been described with coadministration of carbamazepine and an SSRI. In the case presented, the patient had been taking carbamazepine for 14\\xa0days after discontinuing fluoxetine. The temporal relationship between the development of SJS after the addition of carbamazepine suggests that carbamazepine was the causative agent. Although the median latency period (interquartile range) for the development of SJS with carbamazepine is 15\\xa0days (12–20) [12], latency periods of 4\\xa0weeks have also been reported [13]. The latency period for SSRI-induced SJS is 1–3\\xa0weeks. Using the Algorithm of Drug causality for Epidermal Necrolysis (ALDEN) scoring system for SJS/TEN, carbamazepine scored +6 and fluoxetine scored +2. Therefore, carbamazepine and fluoxetine were considered ‘very probable’ and ‘possible’ causes of SJS, respectively, in our patient [14].\\n\\nCarbamazepine-induced SJS has long been thought of as an idiosyncratic, dose independent, unpredictable adverse event specific to an individual [15]; however, current evidence indicates that carbamazepine-induced SJS/TEN is a predictable, specific, delayed hypersensitivity immune reaction involving human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles specific for carbamazepine and other drugs in defined populations [16]. HLA-B*15:02 and HLA-B*31:01 have been associated with carbamazepine-induced SJS in Asian (Han Chinese, Thai, Indian and Malaysian) and Caucasian (and Japanese) populations, respectively [17–19]. Recent evidence suggests this possibility, as shown by the phenytoin and nevirapine-induced SJS/TEN associated with reduced drug clearance due to metaboliser enzyme polymorphisms [20, 21]. However, we were not able to genotype our patient for HLA alleles, therefore we cannot confirm the involvement of the phenotype-specific characteristics of the patient that might have contributed to the development of SJS. Although association with specific HLA genotypes may be necessary, it is not sufficient for the development of SJS/TEN [18]. Other factors such as the individual variation in drug metabolism or clearance, HIV-1 seropositivity, polypharmacy, and competitive drug inhibition may also play an important role in SJS/TEN development with carbamazepine [1, 18, 22, 23].'], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: An Interesting Case of Carbamazepine-Induced Stevens-Johnson Syndrome., context: ['It has been postulated that no biologic effect is dose-independent [24] and that immune-mediated reactions only occur when a critical dose threshold has been reached [15, 25]. The maximum incidence for idiosyncratic reactions is often at a dose below the therapeutic range and remains constant within the therapeutic range [24]; however, this biologic dose-dependency principle (and possibly immune tolerance) is used successfully in desensitisation protocols for the safe introduction of medicines known to have idiosyncratic reactions [15, 24, 25]. Given the current understanding of idiosyncratic reactions, a potential increase in carbamazepine plasma concentration due to CYP3A4 inhibition by fluoxetine and norfluoxetine may have reached the threshold for the immune-mediated carbamazepine-induced SJS in our patient, leading to the observed adverse reaction [25, 26]. Increases in plasma carbamazepine or its metabolites increases the likelihood of adverse events, and possibly SJS, as occurs with phenytoin [27, 28]. It is possible that prior administration with fluoxetine may have increased the risk for SJS in our patient. The inhibitory capacity on CYP3A4 substrate clearance can persist up to 3\\xa0weeks post administration of fluoxetine due to the long half-life of norfluoxetine [29]. In our patient, carbamazepine was administered 14\\xa0days after fluoxetine was discontinued; however, we were unable to measure plasma concentrations of carbamazepine to confirm that competitive inhibition of metabolic enzymes by fluoxetine or norfluoxetine was involved in the development of SJS in our patient. Therefore, we cannot conclude that prior administration of fluoxetine may have increased the risk of carbamazepine-induced SJS.\\n\\nAlthough epidermal necrolysis is rare with the use of SSRIs, several case reports have been documented for SJS or TEN with mirtazapine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine and paroxetine [6–10]. Many of the reported cases have occurred in female patients who had received an SSRI for a duration ranging from 3 to 14\\xa0days. In our case, the patient had discontinued fluoxetine for 14\\xa0days when she developed SJS. However, fluoxetine and its major metabolite norfluoxetine have long elimination half-lives of 1–4 days and 7–15\\xa0days, respectively [30]. Although it is possible that fluoxetine or its metabolite norfluoxetine was involved in the development of SJS in our patient, it is more likely that the SJS was caused by carbamazepine and not by fluoxetine.\\n\\nConclusions'], hint: None\n",

However, the occurrence of serious adverse events may cause a decline in QOL. We investigated the relationship between outpatient chemotherapy-induced adverse events and QOL.\\n\\n\\nMETHODS\\nA single-center retrospective descriptive study was conducted in patients who received outpatient chemotherapy at Gifu University Hospital (Gifu, Japan) between September 2017 and December 2018. The utility values of QOL, type and severity of adverse events, type of cancer, chemotherapy regimen, and other patient demographics were analyzed. Adverse events were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. QOL was evaluated using the Japanese version of the EuroQol 5 Dimension 5 Level (EQ-5D-5L).

According to proportional odds logistic regression, the adverse events that significantly correlated with a decreased EQ-5D-5L utility value were malaise, edema of the limbs, peripheral neuropathy, pruritus, and dry skin. Based on the proportional odds logistic analysis, neither cancer type nor anticancer drugs were significantly correlated with the EQ-5D-5L utility value in patients who received chemotherapy.

Moreover, cancer chemotherapy has transitioned from inpatient to outpatient settings because of advancements in supportive care measures against cancer and changes in the healthcare environment to reduce medical costs [1–4]. Hence, patients are able to continue their personal life and work by undergoing chemotherapy in an outpatient setting. In fact, Ishiura et al.

This effect may reduce patients’ QOL. Tachi et al. [8] showed that the occurrence of anorexia induced by chemotherapy significantly reduced the QOL of patients with breast cancer. Furthermore, Mark et al. [9] reported that patients with advanced-stage lung cancer who experienced strong negative feelings related to side effects have decreased health-related QOL, and recommended facilitating vigorous management of low-grade adverse events to enhance the health-related QOL of patients.

The EQ-5D-5L is widely used in clinical studies and health status surveys targeting the general population and uses a comprehensive scale based on preferences to assess cardinal changes in health status [15, 16]. While the values in the Japanese version [14] differ from those in the original, the utility values of QOL in this study were calculated using the Japanese version of the EQ-5D-5L to reflect the values of the Japanese people. We used a hybrid model prepared by mapping discrete choice experiment (DCE) data onto composite time trade-off (cTTO) data [14] to determine the EQ-5D-5L utility value.\\n\\nWe applied to the EuroQoL Group for use of the Japanese version of the questionnaire and obtained permission before use. The Japanese version of the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire was used in face-to-face interviews to estimate the utility values of QOL [14] and was routinely implemented by pharmacists during each patient visit. The utility values were recorded in the hospital’s electronic medical records.\\n\\nThe five dimensions assessed by the EQ-5D-5L are mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each of these is assessed according to five levels of severity: level 1, no problem; level 2, slight problem; level 3, moderate problem; level 4, severe problem; and level 5, unable or extreme problem [13]. A utility value ranging from 0 to 1 was calculated from the EQ-5D-5L, which was defined as the primary outcome of this study. According to the Japanese version of the utility value conversion table, “0” indicates death and “1” indicates full health [17].

Therefore, we investigated the changes in QOL induced by anticancer drugs in patients with peripheral neuropathy. These changes were examined at three time points: prior to peripheral sensory neuropathy (control), during the development of peripheral sensory neuropathy (pre-intervention), and after pharmaceutical intervention for peripheral sensory neuropathy (post-intervention).\\n\\nSpecifically, to show that utility values for QOL were reduced by the appearance of peripheral neuropathy, we compared utility values for QOL between “control” and “pre-intervention” time points.

The proportional odds logistic model, also termed the ordinal logistic model, is a popular model for analyzing ordered outcome variables. This model performs well for skewed continuous outcome variables using the ranks of data. In addition to the moving difference between the current and previous grade of adverse events (changing grade), age and sex were included in the multivariable model.

Organ systems that rely most on aerobic metabolism, such as the brain, heart and the skeletal muscle, are more inclined to be influenced by mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondrial disease affects multiple organs with various severity, ranging from skeletal muscles alone, or the central nervous system to multiorgan system impairment with myopathy, and presents with heterogeneous clinical manifestations (1). The term of isolated mitochondrial myopathy refers to the condition where mitochondrial disorders primarily affect the skeletal muscle system. The clinical features of isolated mitochondrial myopathy can be highly variable, including mild exercise intolerance, fatigue, muscle weakness, myalgia, mild elevated serum creatine kinase and more rare, rhabdomyolysis (2).'], hint: None\n",

However, an acute episode of respiratory failure as the initial and predominant clinical feature in adult-onset mitochondrial myopathy is rarely reported and is easily misdiagnosed as other neuromuscular disorders, such as Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) and myasthenia gravis (MG). Here we report on a 52-years-old man who presented with acute respiratory failure as the initial and predominant manifestation after receiving a painless gastroscopy and colonoscopy examination with use of anesthetic drugs. He was diagnosed with mitochondrial myopathy by histochemical findings of ragged red fibers (RRF) in the skeletal muscle biopsy and an A3243G point mutation of the mitochondrial tRNALeu gene in a peripheral blood specimen. Further, we performed a literature review on clinical features of adult-onset isolated mitochondrial myopathy with abrupt episodes of respiratory dysfunction as the early and predominant manifestation. Eleven cases have been reported in nine studies (including our study), and five of whom received DNA analysis all carried the A3243G mutation in the tRNALeu gene of the mtDNA (3, 5–11).\\n\\nCase Report\\nA 52-years-old man was transferred to our intensive care unit in July 2016 because of an acute episode of respiratory failure after using anesthetic drugs 8 days earlier. He felt easily fatigued and developed insidiously limb weakness in the previous 6 months. He attributed this to toothache resulting in a poor appetite. However, he was still able to maintain his daily life and keep on working. His family noticed that he lost 7.5 kg of body weight in 6 months and took him to the gastroenterology department of a local hospital. He received a painless gastroscopy and colonoscopy examination using propofol on 19 July 2016. He regained consciousness very slowly for over forty min and was found to have hypoxemia with a blood oxygen saturation degree (SO2) of 86%. After expectant treatment of oxygen inhalation, he recovered to a relative stable condition and drove home. He developed increasing shortness of breath in the following days, which eventually deteriorated into acute respiratory failure. Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis showed a pH of 7.25, and a PaCO2 of 86.25 mmHg. Although the PaO2 level was in a normal range by treatment of oxygen inhalation, the diagnosis of type II respiratory failure was considered because of hypercapnia. A pulmonary function test suggested a moderate restrictive ventilator impairment. No evidence of pneumonia or bronchitis was found through Computed Tomography (CT) scanning. Since he developed recurrent episodes of hypoxemia, hypercapnia and delirium, he received artificial ventilatory assistance on July 26th. Next day, he was transferred to our hospital.'], hint: None\n",

The clinical management of patients with metastatic GISTs is exceptionally challenging due to their poor prognosis. Apatinib is a multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Here, we present the unique case with metastatic GISTs who derived clinical benefit from apatinib following the failure of imatinib and sunitinib. Case presentation: A 57-year-old man was admitted to our hospital diagnosed with metastatic and recurrent GISTs following surgical resection. Fifty-four months after the first-line imatinib treatment, he developed progressive disease and then was treated with cytoreductive surgery combined with imatinib. Disease progression occurred after 7 months. He then received second-line sunitinib and achieved a progression-free survival of 11 months. Apatinib mesylate was then administered. Follow-up imaging revealed a stable disease. Progression-free survival following apatinib therapy was at least 8 months. The only toxicities were hypertension and proteinuria, which were both controllable and well-tolerated. Conclusions: Treatment with apatinib provides an additional option for the treatment of patients with GISTs refractory to imatinib and sunitinib.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nGastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal neoplasms of the gastrointestinal tract (1). Most GISTs harbor activating mutations in either gene encoding KIT or platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α (PDGFRA) (2, 3), which are type III receptor tyrosine kinases (4). After the identification of activating mutations, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are used for GISTs (5), which also significantly improved prognosis of patients with metastatic or recurrent disease (6). Imatinib mesylate is recommended as initial therapy based on drug activity and drug tolerability according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline for advanced GISTs (7). For patients with metastatic or unresectable GISTs after the failure of imatinib, sunitinib is considered (7). However, resistance to sunitinib eventually develops in most patients, after a median of 6–9 months (8). Although regorafenib can significantly improve survival as the third-line treatment, median progression-free survival (PFS) was only 4.8 months. Therefore, the development of efficacious and safe therapies is required for the treatment of metastatic or unresectable GISTs after the failure of imatinib and sunitinib.'], hint: None\n",

Here, we present a case with metastatic GISTs that was effectively treated by apatinib following the failure of imatinib and sunitinib, demonstrating the potential efficacy of apatinib in the treatment of metastatic or unresectable GISTs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of metastatic GISTs that responds to apatinib.\\n\\nCase Presentation\\nA 57-year-old asymptomatic man was found to have multiple intestinal masses by computed tomography (CT) done as part of his routine medical examination in December 2011. Surgical resection (R0) was performed in December 2011. The resected specimen consisted of a mass measuring 10.0 ×10.0 cm in maximal diameter.

Twenty to twenty-five percent of GISTs lack KIT mutations, and of these tumors, a minority (10%) have PDGFRA mutations that are homologous to KIT mutations (prevalence of PDGFRA mutations is about 10%) (4, 16). Still, both KIT and PDGFRA mutations are missing in up to 15% of GISTs, which are called wild-type GISTs. In recent years, an increasing number of TKIs for patients with GISTs after the failure of imatinib and sunitinib have been studied. Regorafenib is the only targeted drug approved by the Federal Drug Administration for advanced GISTs after the failure of imatinib and sunitinib.

Similarly, apatinib is a potent VEGFR inhibitor apart from the KIT inhibitor. The role of VEGF in GISTs, however, has not been established. Imamura et al. suggested that angiogenesis associated with VEGF might play an important role in in the progression of GISTs (22). Several ex vivo studies of GIST specimens have demonstrated that microvessel density is associated with VEGF expression and closely related to the prognosis of the disease (23, 24). Recently, Verboom et al. proposed that SNPs in the genes encoding for VEGFR2 was associated with PFS in patients with advanced GISTs treated with imatinib (25). Consolino et al. suggested that VEGFR2 and VEGFR3 expression may be related to progression of imatinib-resistant GISTs, and the direct targeting of the receptors may have the potential to decrease tumor growth by the inhibition of angiogenesis (26).

Her renal function deteriorated rapidly. Serum immunoglobulin and complement levels were within normal ranges. An autoantibody examination showed negative for antinuclear antibody and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody. Histologic examination of a renal biopsy specimen revealed that all of the glomeruli had severe crescent formations with no immune deposits. The patient was treated with steroid pulse therapy with cyclophosphamide followed by oral prednisolone. Fifteen days later, she experienced massive recurrent hematochezia.

We report a case of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-negative pauci-immune glomerulonephritis with massive intestinal bleeding and cerebral hemorrhage.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nPauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis (GN) is one of the most common causes of rapidly progressive GN (RPGN). Most patients with pauci-immune crescentic GN have glomerular disease as part of an antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)–associated systemic vasculitis, such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, or as a part of renal-limited vasculitis [1]. Because ~75–90% of patients with pauci-immune crescentic GN have circulating ANCA, ANCA is known as a major serologic marker to distinguish pauci-immune crescentic GN from other types of RPGN [2]. Although there is little information about ANCA-negative pauci-immune crescentic GN owing to a relatively small number of patients, several studies have reported fewer systemic vasculitis manifestations in ANCA-negative crescentic GN than ANCA-positive cases. Hemorrhagic complications in pauci-immune crescentic GN are common, but massive gastrointestinal bleeding or cerebral hemorrhage in ANCA-negative pauci-immune crescentic GN has rarely been reported. Herein, we report a rare case of recurrent massive intestinal bleeding that was caused by an uncontrolled vasculitis combined with ANCA-negative pauci-immune crescentic GN.\\n\\nCase report'], hint: None\n",

Pitting edema greater than Grade III of the lower limbs was noted. Lung auscultation was normal, and no purpura was found on the skin. Initial laboratory test results showed white blood cell count 8,300/mm3; hemoglobin 10.7\\xa0g/L; platelets 277,000/mm3; blood urea nitrogen 54.5\\xa0mg/dL; serum creatinine 3.5\\xa0mg/dL; total protein 5.9\\xa0g/dL; albumin 3.0\\xa0g/dL; total calcium 8.4\\xa0g/dL; phosphorus 5.0\\xa0mg/dL; prothrombin time (international normalized ratio) 1.08; and activated partial thromboplastin time 34 seconds. Urinalysis revealed many red blood cells (RBCs) per high-power field, and protein (4+) and occult blood (2+) were also detected. The spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio was 3.5\\xa0g/g.\\n\\nHer renal function deteriorated rapidly over 7 days (serum creatinine concentration increased from 3.5\\xa0mg/dL to 7.0\\xa0mg/dL) and exhibited features of RPGN. Therefore, we performed a renal biopsy and other serologic tests. The serum immunoglobulin levels, including immunoglobulin (Ig)G, IgM, and IgA, and complements, including C3 and C4, were within normal ranges. Immune serologic result was negative for antinuclear antibody and antiglomerular basement membrane antibody. ANCAs also showed negative in indirect immunofluorescence and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.\\n\\nThe renal biopsy specimen showed cellular or fibrocellular crescentic formation in 92% (57/62) of glomeruli (Fig. 1). The tubules revealed focal moderate atrophy and loss with infiltration of mononuclear cells in edematous interstitium. Immunohistochemistry, using three glomeruli, demonstrated no staining for IgG, IgA, IgM, complements (C3, C1q), or fibrinogen. Electron microscopy also showed no dense deposits, with severe effacement of epithelial foot processes.\\n\\nBased on these pathologic findings, she was diagnosed with ANCA-negative pauci-immune crescentic GN.

Initial resuscitation was conducted using a crystalloid solution and packed RBC transfusion. Although emergency gastroscopy and colonoscopy were performed, the bleeding focus was not detected, but a large amount of old blood was observed in the terminal ileum. After 2 days, a colonoscopy was performed again, but abnormal findings associated with bleeding were not detected. Then, a capsule endoscopy was attempted to determine if the bleeding focus was located in the small bowel. However, owing to a slow small bowel transit time, the entire small bowel could not be observed because the capsule did not reach the mid-to-distal ileum. On the 22nd hospital day, recurrent massive hematochezia occurred. Abdominal computed tomography angiography showed active arterial bleeding on the ileal loop, and selective superior mesenteric arteriography revealed an active contrast extravasation in a branch of the distal ileal artery (Fig. 3). We selectively performed embolization with a permanent embolic agent (n-butyl cyanoacrylate; 0.5\\xa0mL tissue adhesive, 1.5\\xa0mL ethionidized oil mixture), and the bleeding stopped.\\n\\nDespite successful embolization, massive hematochezia occurred again after 2 days. Her hemoglobin level was 6.5\\xa0g/dL, and platelet count was 40,000/mm3. The patient received two units of packed RBCs and five units of platelet concentrate. Emergency colonoscopy showed multiple segmental ulcerations on the terminal ileum, which was consistent with ischemic damage due to embolization of the distal ileal artery (Fig. 4). The patient underwent hemodialysis because of intractable metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, and fluid overload. Anemia associated with schistocytes and transfusion-refractory consumptive thrombocytopenia was also present, consistent with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA).

      "Predicting with title: Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-negative pauci-immune glomerulonephritis with massive intestinal bleeding., context: ['Pauci-immune crescentic GN is part of systemic small-vessel vasculitis and usually associated with the presence of ANCAs directed against myeloperoxidase or proteinase 3. Although the pathogenesis of ANCA in vasculitis is not fully understood, ANCA is known to activate neutrophils by different mechanisms, such as direct Fab02 binding to ANCA antigens on leukocyte surfaces or Fc receptor engagement by ANCA immune complexes, leading to apoptosis and necrosis of neutrophil and endothelial cells [3]. However, in ANCA-negative small-vessel vasculitis, neutrophil infiltration of the pathologic lesion is reportedly related with other unidentified autoantibodies or T-cell–dependent mechanisms [4].\\n\\nDespite limited information about ANCA-negative pauci-immune crescentic GN, ANCA-negative patients reportedly show severe renal manifestations, such as nephrotic-range proteinuria, poorer renal outcomes, and less extrarenal involvement such as fever, arthralgia, skin rash, abdominal pain, or mononeuritis multiplex, compared with ANCA-positive patients [5–7]. Similarly, our case also showed nephrotic-range proteinuria of 3.5\\xa0g/d and diffuse cellular crescentic formations in >90% of glomeruli on renal biopsy. Initially, extrarenal manifestations were not observed.\\n\\nOur patient had no evidence of asthma, eosinophilia, or granuloma of the upper respiratory tract. Based on the 2012 International Chapel Hill Consensus criteria, we were able to diagnose MPA and exclude granulomatosis with polyangiitis and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis from the possible systemic small-vessel vasculitis conditions. Hemorrhagic complications in patients with pauci-immune crescentic GN are common [8]. Small-vessel vasculitis can cause local or diffuse pathologic changes in the gastrointestinal tract, including ulcers, bowel wall edema, hemorrhage, paralytic ileus, ischemia, obstruction, and perforation [9–12]. Although necrotizing GN and pulmonary capillaritis are very common in MPA, several cases with gastrointestinal bleeding have been reported. Interestingly, a Japanese case diagnosed with MPA and pauci-immune crescentic GN showed active bleeding of the superior pancreaticoduodenal artery and iliac branch of the superior mesenteric artery [13]. The characteristics of this case were very similar to those of the present case: old age, absence of circulating ANCA, massive active bleeding, and absence of small artery involvement on kidney biopsy. However, our case showed a poor clinical course and a feature of MAHA. Thrombotic microangiopathy is characterized by platelet aggregation in systemic circulation, thrombocytopenia, and mechanical hemolysis. Although coexistence of thrombotic microangiopathy and pauci-immune crescentic GN is rare, pauci-immune crescentic GN could trigger thrombotic microangiopathy through endothelial damage by proinflammatory mediators [14].

      "Predicting with title: Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-negative pauci-immune glomerulonephritis with massive intestinal bleeding., context: ['outcomes.\\n\\nInitiation of conventional treatment for pauci-immune crescentic GN with or without ANCA consists of intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy followed by progressive reduction of oral prednisolone (initially 1\\xa0mg/kg/24\\xa0h) and cyclophosphamide, either intravenously at a dose of 0.5–1\\xa0g/m2 or orally at a dose of 2–3\\xa0mg/kg/24\\xa0h [15]. Our patient received conventional treatment according to this schedule, but massive hematochezia occurred 15 days later. In life- or organ-threatening conditions, such as lung hemorrhage or severe ANCA-related renal vasculitis, plasma exchange may be recommended. In cases with gastrointestinal bleeding, widely accepted treatment methods are lacking. Therefore, our patient only received embolization without plasmapheresis or other immunosuppressants, based on previous reports. The causes of intracerebral bleeding in our patient were not clear. Although there was a high possibility of the hemorrhagic complications of systemic vasculitis, brain magnetic resonance angiography was not performed. Various factors that could increase bleeding tendency, such as a uremic condition, low platelet count, or frequent transfusions, may contribute to intracerebral bleeding.\\n\\nIn summary, to the best of our knowledge, there are only a few reports regarding ANCA-negative pauci-immune crescentic GN with massive gastrointestinal bleeding.

Most adverse reactions to this group of medications are classified as psychomotor, autonomic or toxic. In the case of suspected hypersensitivity to local anesthetics, skin testing is considered to be a useful tool - patch tests and intradermal tests for delayed hypersensitivity and skin prick tests and intradermal tests for immediate reactions. There is a particular need for such a diagnostic procedure, as patients suspected of hypersensitivity to local anesthetic drugs are frequently admitted.\\n\\n\\nOBJECTIVE\\nTo highlight the problem of hypersensitivity to local anesthetics on the basis of authors' own experience and literature data.\\n\\n\\nMETHODS\\nWe present cases of 5 patients referred to the clinic by their dentists with a suspicion of allergy to local anesthetics, four to lidocaine and 1 to articaine.\\n\\n\\nRESULTS\\nIntradermal tests were positive in 1 out of 5 subjects, with a concomitant episode of urticaria. In 1 patient we obtained a doubtful result of intradermal tests. Skin prick tests and patch tests were negative in all cases. In 2 cases we performed an incremental challenge test also with a negative result.\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nIt has to be emphasized that, although rare, consequences of true allergy to local anesthetics can be serious considering a patient's future management and therapy. That is why this diagnosis may be crucial.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nLidocaine represents the most common local anesthetic (LA) agent employed in local or regional anesthesia, included as a constituent of EMLA, a eutectic mixture of lidocaine and prilocaine [1, 2]. Although most allergic reactions are due to the common metabolic product of the ester local anesthetic, para-amino benzoic acid, cross-reactivity among esters is common. Ingredients in LA solutions such as antioxidants or preservatives including metabisulphite or parabens may also elicit allergic or adverse reactions. Articaine solutions should be avoided in those allergic or hypersensitive to sulphite, due to the content of sodium metabisulphite as the vasoconstrictor's antioxidant in it. The LA (without preservatives or adrenaline) may be skin tested.\\n\\nTrue allergy to LA is rare, with a genuine immunological reaction representing only 1% of all adverse reactions to these medications [3–5]. In traditional classifications, adverse reactions to LA have been categorized as allergic, toxic and autonomic [3]. Most of the patients undergoing dental procedures exhibit some degree of autonomic response to an injection, such as sweating, tachycardia or even syncope. However, it is usually mild and transient. Toxic reactions are mostly observed as a consequence of a rapid intra-vascular injection of LA or may be associated with an overdose in patients defectively metabolizing the drug.\"], hint: None\n",

All patients were referred to our Department by their dentists with a suspicion of allergy to LA. In the case of 4 patients, lidocaine was suspected as a culprit drug; in 1 case, articaine was suspected.\\n\\nThree patients experienced an adverse reaction 2–2.5 months prior to diagnosis. In 2 subjects, the time interval between the reaction and diagnosis was much longer, being 17 and 25 years.

In regards of the type of the adverse event, 2 patients experienced syncope, 1 had an episode of disseminated urticarial wheals and another had cardiac palpitations and anxiety.

In the majority of cases, hypersensitivity to this group of drugs may be excluded. It is suggested that the amide class of LA (lidocaine, mepivacaine, bupivacaine, articaine, prilocaine) is significantly less allergic than the ester type (benzocaine, procaine, tetracaine), There is also limited cross-reactivity between amide LA drugs [11]. However, according to data published by Zanni et al. [12], good agreement may be observed between clinical sensitization, PT and lymphocyte transformation test, indicating that there is a high degree of cross-reactivity between lidocaine and mepivacaine, also on the clonal level.\\n\\nAmong allergic reactions to LA, type IV hypersensitivity responses have been described predominantly to ester LA and clinically are represented by either contact dermatitis or rashes (macular or maculopapular) [13]. Torres et al. [14] also described the first case of fixed drug eruption induced by mepivacaine. This report was followed by others [15, 16]. Contact allergy to amide anesthetics is rare and, according to Klein and Gall [17] in 1991, only 18 cases had been reported since these medications began to be used in the 1940s. Most of the delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions take place after a topical application of the drug [18]. There have been also reports of cases presenting as contact dermatitis due to subcutaneous administration of LA, which have been confirmed by patch testing. Bircher et al. [13] described a case of a delayed-type reaction to LA with subsequent positive PT to lidocaine, mepivacaine and prilocaine but negative to articaine. Kanerva et al. [19] described a case of a 48-year-old patient, who developed contact dermatitis after an infiltration with mepivacaine and lidocaine and they concluded that diagnostic approach of a patient suspected of delayed-type hypersensitivity to LA should include not only PT, but also IDT.\\n\\nImmediate IgE-mediated allergic responses, particularly to amide type LA, are uncommon. According to some authors, in more than 30 years of their practice, there has never been verified an immediate allergic reaction to LA using available diagnostic technology [10]. However, there are case reports of adverse reactions to LA, suggesting type I hypersensitivity, where signs and symptoms tend to occur within minutes of drug injection and include urticaria, episodes of angioneurotic edema, wheezing, sneezing, pruritus or even anaphylactic shock [3, 10].'], hint: None\n",

No complications were noted at the time of the procedure. The position of the line was confirmed with fluoroscopy and routine chest X‐ray (Fig 1).\\n\\nFigure 1 Chest X ray confirming the position of the central venous catheter.\\n\\nThe first cycle of chemotherapy consisted of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. Following the infusion of doxorubicin, the patient soon complained of severe right side pleuritic chest pain.

This visually confirmed that the tip of the central catheter was lodged in the pleural space but there was no frank pneumonitis or direct parenchymal injury to the lung (Fig 2). Ten liters of warmed normal saline were used to wash out the pleural space.

This process causes cell death and continues to do so as more of the drug is released into the surrounding tissue, causing pain, as in the described case.2\\n\\n\\nThe topoisomerase II inhibitor and iron chelator, dexrazoxane, has been proven to prevent the potentially devastating effects of anthracycline extravasation. It is highly effective with minimal side effects and is well tolerated by patients.3 Dexrazoxane is approved by the Food and Drug Administration, but not the Therapeutic Goods Administration, and has limited availability in Australia.\\n\\nExtravasation is caused by mal‐positioning of central venous catheters, which can be classified as primary occurring at the time of placement, or secondary occurring sometime after placement. The causes of secondary mal‐positioning are poorly understood, as in our case, where initial investigation seemed to confirm correct positioning (Fig 1). Fracture and distal embolization of the catheter as part of the “pinch‐off” syndrome is far more common.4\\n\\n\\nBecause of the small number of thoracic extravasation injuries, there is no consensus on the most appropriate treatment, which is extrapolated from experience with peripheral access.5 Surgical procedures with the objective of draining the remaining solution after discontinuation of the infusion, along with dexrazoxane, must be considered as soon as possible to prevent major complications.\\n\\nSurgical options, such as percutaneous drainage, thoracoscopy, and open thoracotomy can be used. Unfortunately, the percutaneous option can cause subsequent complications because of the visual limitations of insertion, as in a case reported by Uges et al. where the percutaneous drainage was complicated by empyema.6\\n\\n\\nIn our case, we decided to use video‐assisted thoracoscopy to confirm the catheter position and to further assess the local tissue damage from doxorubicin. It also guided an accurate lavage of the cavity, the placement of the catheters that were used posteriorly for continuous irrigation, and helped to safely remove the mal‐positioned catheter (Fig 2).\\n\\nIn conclusion, combined early medical and surgical management of pleural extravasation of cytotoxic drugs, such as anthracyclines, is essential. Video‐assisted thoracoscopy can confirm tissue damage and aid drainage, lavage, and subsequent irrigation of the cavity.

The patient developed abdominal distension and experienced a gradual deterioration in health during 2007, with admission to The First Affiliated Hospital in May 2007. The patient presented with severe abdominal distension and breathing difficulty on May 15 and appeared to be in critical condition. Ultrasound examination revealed massive ascites and left-side pleural effusion. Thoracentesis and abdominocentesis were performed, and 300 mg carboplatin was administered intraperitoneally on May 19, followed by a second abdominocentesis on May 21.

Once clinical symptoms are apparent, patients have developed mid- to late-stage ovarian cancer, at which point aggressive treatments may yield more favorable results than conservative ones. Surgery remains the primary treatment for stage III ovarian cancer and allows removal of gross disease. Following surgery, intravenous (IV) or intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy extends the survival time of patients and is associated with superior results for recurrent ovarian cancer relative to other treatment modes. In addition to IV and IP chemotherapy, other treatment regimens, including oral chemotherapy, hormones and gonadotrophin-releasing hormone antagonists, exert certain positive effects (2).

However, the outcome of chemotherapy for elderly patients with advanced disease and a poor performance status has not been reported. Chemotherapy is also contraindicated for patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance statuses of 3 or 4.\\n\\nThe combination of bevacizumab with carboplatin/paclitaxel is associated with significantly longer disease-free survival than carboplatin/paclitaxel alone. However, no significant difference has been observed between bevacizumab plus carboplatin/paclitaxel and carboplatin/paclitaxel in terms of overall survival rate (5). Thus, bevacizumab does not appear to confer any survival advantage, and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network panel does not recommend its use.

      "Predicting with title: The tacrolimus metabolism rate influences renal function after kidney transplantation., context: [\"The effective calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) tacrolimus (Tac) is an integral part of the standard immunosuppressive regimen after renal transplantation (RTx). However, as a potent CNI it has nephrotoxic potential leading to impaired renal function in some cases. Therefore, it is of high clinical impact to identify factors which can predict who is endangered to develop CNI toxicity. We hypothesized that the Tac metabolism rate expressed as the blood concentration normalized by the dose (C/D ratio) is such a simple predictor. Therefore, we analyzed the impact of the C/D ratio on kidney function after RTx. Renal function was analyzed 1, 2, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after RTx in 248 patients with an immunosuppressive regimen including basiliximab, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and prednisolone. According to keep the approach simple, patients were split into three C/D groups: fast, intermediate and slow metabolizers. Notably, compared with slow metabolizers fast metabolizers of Tac showed significantly lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) values at all the time points analyzed. Moreover, fast metabolizers underwent more indication renal biopsies (p\\u200a=\\u200a0.006) which revealed a higher incidence of CNI nephrotoxicity (p\\u200a=\\u200a0.015) and BK nephropathy (p\\u200a=\\u200a0.024) in this group. We herein identified the C/D ratio as an easy calculable risk factor for the development of CNI nephrotoxicity and BK nephropathy after RTx. We propose that the simple C/D ratio should be taken into account early in patient's risk management strategies.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nThe calcineurin-inhibitor (CNI) tacrolimus (Tac) is one of the most effective immunosuppressive drugs used for renal transplantation (RTx). In combination with mycophenolate mofetil, prednisolone and daclizumab, Tac regimen showed a superior graft function, better prevention of acute rejection and superior graft survival after 12 months compared to cyclosporine A and sirolimus [1].\\n\\nUnfortunately, Tac has a narrow therapeutic window. It can lead to acute as well as to chronic nephrotoxicity. Acute Tac nephrotoxicity due to high Tac levels typically presents early after RTx as e.g. isometric vacuolizations of tubular cells. In fact, even as early as one month after RTx, glomerulosclerosis in renal allografts can be associated to CNI nephrotoxicity. Typical chronic CNI-related allograft changes include tubule-interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy (IF/TA), tubular microcalcifications, glomerulosclerosis and artheriolar hyalinosis. Acute tubular damage can be reversed within the first three months after RTx, however, chronic lesions observed after the third month are usually progressive ones [2]–[4].\"], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: The tacrolimus metabolism rate influences renal function after kidney transplantation., context: ['Although there seems to be a strong association between higher CNI trough levels and nephrotoxicity [5], nephrotoxic effects of Tac can occur even at prescribed low-level regimens (4–6 ng/mL) [6]. In that context it is important that Tac metabolism depends on individual factors - clinical and genetic ones. Clinical variables like haematocrit, serum albumin, age, gender, body mass index (BMI) or absorption have been proposed to be significant influencing variables [7], [8]. However, some are still a matter of debate. The most relevant genes encode the cytochrome-P450 enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 leading to significant differences in Tac pharmacodynamics [9]. However, genetic profiling of patients is still far from been a routine test and the dosage needed to reach target Tac level varies in patients with known CYP3A polymorphisms over the time [10]. Of higher clinical relevance is that physicians have to take interactions influencing Tac metabolism into account when prescribing new drugs. In the transplant setting interactions with other immunosuppressive drugs, such as corticosteroids, sirolimus and everolimus are considered in daily routine. Nevertheless, the clinical relevance of these interactions remains widely unclear [11]. Yet another unanswered question of interest is, if the presence of CYP3A5 in the apical tubular plasma membrane observed in kidneys with CNI nephrotoxicity is causally relevant or not [12], [13].\\n\\nTherefore, factors which can predict patients’ risk to develop Tac side effects or promote clinically reasonable handling of Tac are of high interest to transplant surgeons and nephrologists.\\n\\nWe hypothesize that the Tac metabolism rate expressed as the simple blood concentration normalized by the dose (C/D ratio) is such a predictor.\\n\\nMaterials and Methods\\nStudy population and clinical data\\nWe analyzed data from 311 patients who underwent RTx between January 2007 and March 2012.

Blood tests at that time (as indicated in Figure 1, day 23), showed undetectable HCV viral load, with new elevations of liver enzymes and she was advised to increase oral hydration for symptomatic relief. One week later (day 30), she presented to emergency room with complaints of profound weakness and myalgia along with ongoing nausea and abdominal pain. On physical examination, she appeared slightly dry, with slight periumbilical tenderness and without ascites. She demonstrated diffuse muscle weakness and muscle tenderness in all extremities. No focal neurologic deficit was identified. The admission labs (as noted in Table 1 and Figure 1, day 30) were noticeable for elevated liver enzymes, creatinine, and creatine phosphokinase (CPK). Urinalysis showed large amount of blood, without RBCs. Clinical diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis was made. Her atorvastatin was stopped and she was aggressively fluid resuscitated. CPK levels subsequently trended down and renal function returned to baseline. The workup for myalgia was unremarkable, with normal aldolase, C3 and C4 complement levels, TSH, and serum protein electrophoresis. Neurology evaluation was done, and EMG was done to evaluate for profound muscular weakness. EMG showed diffuse muscle irritability with no evidence of polyneuropathy, suggesting this patient had an inflammatory myopathy.\\n\\nRhabdomyolysis was considered likely from an interaction between Sof/Led, atorvastatin, and colchicine in the background of abnormal renal function. The rise of AST/ALT was considered to be from her rhabdomyolysis (nonhepatic). Colchicine was also stopped and she was continued on Sof/Led and low dose ribavirin with daily monitoring of her labs. By the time of discharge, her rhabdomyolysis resolved, with return of baseline GFR of 43\\u2009mL/min/1.73\\u2009m2. Although her myalgia improved, she was discharged home with persistent muscle weakness, which subsequently improved over the next 4 weeks with physical rehabilitation. She successfully completed 12-week course of HCV therapy and did not have any recurrent symptoms or findings of rhabdomyolysis as she was kept off atorvastatin and colchicine. Her muscle weakness had resolved by the time she finished her therapy.

Sof is a nucleotide NS5B polymerase inhibitor and Led is an NS5A inhibitor for HCV [2]. The common side effects of Sof/Led are fatigue and headache.

In addition, the Sof/Led label does not mention many drug interactions; however both components are P-gp substrates [4]. Led is an inhibitor of the drug transporters P-gp and Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) and may increase intestinal absorption of coadministered substrates for these transporters [5]. Sof/Led is not recommended to be given with other known P-gp-inducers due to the potential for decrease in efficacy. Led can increase absorption of colchicine by P-gp inhibition and of rosuvastatin via inhibition of BCRP. Coadministration of Sof/Led with rosuvastatin can potentially increase the risk of statin related myopathy and rhabdomyolysis [6]. Sof accumulation in renal failure can also lead to toxicity and the patient should be closely monitored for liver failure if Sof is to be used in these patients. Additionally, colchicine has the independent ability to cause myotoxicity [7]. Sof/Led has not been noted to interact adversely with atorvastatin; however, a theoretical interaction exists via P-gp inhibition by atorvastatin, causing an increased level of led. Atorvastatin can itself increase levels of colchicine due to P-gp inhibition. Using colchicine in combination with a statin has been reported to cause myotoxicity, especially in the setting of CKD [8]. Atorvastatin 80\\u2009mg was used in this patient as it was used for secondary prevention for her coronary artery disease. A lower dose of atorvastatin was not attempted as the patient was symptomatic from her rhabdomyolysis and the patient was not having any active coronary artery disease.\\n\\nIn our patient, the addition of the Led in the presence of atorvastatin could have further increased the levels of colchicine, increasing the likelihood of muscle toxicity and causing rhabdomyolysis. Colchicine is renally eliminated and requires dose adjustments based on renal dysfunction. Thus, this patient's stage III CKD combined with a high colchicine dose and P-gp mediated drug interactions could have played a critical role in increasing the chance of this unanticipated toxicity [8]. There was little concern for mitochondrial toxicity caused by a lactic acidosis as the patient has a normal anion gap and normal lactate levels.\\n\\nThe Naranjo probability score [9] was developed to help assess causality for adverse drug reactions and based on score of 6 (Table 2) this patient's adverse event correlates with a probable adverse drug reaction. Although atorvastatin levels were directly measured, the muscle toxicity described was likely attributed to drug interactions in combination with preexisting renal impairment. Sof/Led was coadministered with two drugs known to cause myositis. Drug interactions, via P-gp inhibition, caused increased levels of all drugs, potentially increasing the risk of muscle problem development. It is important for physicians' prescribing Sof/Led to be aware of the potential drug interactions.\"], hint: None\n",

However, nicotine as a drug, and its effects on human psychology are largely under-investigated in genetic studies. In this study, we recruited 208 current non-smokers to evaluate the effect of nicotine and its relationship to genetic risks to nicotine dependence. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, as well as measurement invariance testing, were conducted to evaluate the latent factor structures of the POMS, PANAS and DEN questionnaires across 3 nicotine doses. Structural models were used to examine the effects of nicotine and their relationship to genetic risks of nicotine dependence. We found that nicotine administration led to the change of both measurement construct and factor means, indicating the causal effect of nicotine on the psychological responses. The genotypes of rs588765 predicted the scores of the DEN Confused and Dizzy factors (p = 0.0003 and 0.001 respectively), and rs16969968 and rs588765 were associated with the PANAS Nervous factor (p = 0.006 and 0.007 respectively). Our study suggested that genetic risk of nicotine dependence is associated with acute psychological responses. The integration of psychometric analyses and dose effects could be a powerful approach for genetic study of nicotine dependence.\\n\\nIn the last several years, genetic studies of smoking and nicotine dependence have made significant progress, exemplified by the identification of the CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4 locus. Genetic variants at this locus have been shown to be associated with a number of smoking phenotypes such as the number of cigarettes smoked per day1234, nicotine dependence as defined by DSM IV56 and the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence78, age of smoking onset5910 and plasma cotinine concentration11. This locus includes the CHRNA5, CHRNA3 and CHRNB4 genes. While a non-synonymous SNP, rs16969968, in the CHRNA5 gene has emerged as a functional candidate, it may not be the one tagging the strongest association signal12.

      "Predicting with title: Genetic risks to nicotine dependence predict negative mood and affect in current non-smokers., context: ['Nicotine, the primary psychoactive substance in cigarette smoke, has broad psychological effects on humans14. When first exposed to nicotine, either by smoking or other routes of administration, some people feel pleasant and relaxed, while others feel dizzy and nauseous. These initial responses to nicotine have significant impacts on sustained smoking and subsequent development of nicotine dependence15161718. However, in a typical genetic study, the psychological effects of nicotine are rarely utilized and included in association testing. This omission is due, in part, to the fact that little is known of the relationship between these effects and genetic risks of nicotine dependence. In the literature, there are a few reports on the association between subjective measures and genetic variants in the nicotinic receptors, and some nominal associations are found in the CHRNB3/CHRNA619 and CHRNB220 genes. These studies use the scores of individual items or several items that contribute to a common factor, but these studies do not control for measurement errors and correlations between items, and do not have nicotine dose effect information.\\n\\nPsychometric analysis with structural equation modeling provides a framework for constructing latent factor structures that can take into account measurement errors, item residual correlations and the degree of invariance across multiple waves of data simultaneously. In theory, it can identify and differentiate “true” treatment responses from confounding effects, attribute responses directly to experimental treatments (nicotine administration and dosage), and permit the test of genetic effects on these responses. Thus, integration of structural modeling with association testing may improve statistical power when well targeted hypotheses are postulated. To demonstrate the utility and advantage of this approach, we conducted a pilot study to evaluate the relationship between genetic risks of nicotine dependence and the subjective responses resulting from nicotine administration. We hypothesized that genetic risks of nicotine dependence contributed to subjective responses, and that by integrating psychometric modeling of psychological effects and dose effects we could improve statistical power to detect this genetic association. In a lab setting, we recruited 208 non-smokers, and measured their psychological responses via self-report by the Profile of Mood State (POMS)21, the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS)22, and the Direct Effects of Nicotine scale (DEN)23 after administration of each of a series of nicotine doses.

Towards these goals, we needed first to examine the latent factor structures of the items of the instruments, and to evaluate whether the latent measurement factor structures remained equivalent (i.e. statistically invariant) after the administration of different nicotine doses using measurement invariance (MI) testing procedures. A failure in the MI testing would provide evidence that the latent factor(s) and the individual differences they represent were not constructed equivalently across the nicotine administrations, i.e., individual differences on the latent factors were not calibrated in the same way across administrations, presumably due to differential item responses attributable to the administration of different amounts of nicotine.

Furthermore, intravitreal injection of lidocaine has also been investigated in cats, rabbits, and rats.6, 12, 13 In these animal studies, the electroretinogram analyses revealed a reversible reduction in the amplitude and extinguished b-waves which fully recovered within 10–24\\xa0h. In cats, intravitreal injection of lidocaine has been followed with vacuolization of nerve layers and presence of microscopic lesions in synapses between horizontal, bipolar cells, and photoreceptors. In addition, histopathological retinal structure changes near the injection sites have been detected.\\n\\nOne limitation of our study is that the patient did not consent to perform the ERG and mfERG tests. However, in the presence of positive RAPD, normal retinal examination, and full recovery of vision, the most plausible cause of vision loss would be attributed to lidocaine retinal toxicity. In view of the above, when posterior capsular rupture occurs, it is wise not to repeat intracameral lidocaine to minimize potential retinal toxicity risks.\\n\\nFunding\\nThe authors did not receive any financial support from any public or private sources.

The safe upper limit for daily dosing has variably been thought to be 4000 mg/day or possibly less.2 Excessive APAP dosing can occur with intent of self-harm (suicide attempt) or unintentionally while seeking pain relief, typically for a period of several days by using increased amounts each day.3, 4 Early on, an association was made between alcohol abuse and APAP unintentional overdoses, referred to initially as therapeutic misadventure.5 Both intentional and unintentional APAP overdoses have been shown to be associated with substance abuse of both alcohol and opioids, particularly the opioid (hydrocodone/acetaminophen) combination products.6 In 1 study of 275 APAP-related ALF patients, 55% had a history of alcohol use and 35% a history of alcohol abuse, and 53% had taken an opioid-APAP combination product.4 In a follow-up study of a larger cohort of 306 APAP toxicity survivors, 55% had a history of psychiatric disease compared with only 27% of non-APAP survivors, 46% of APAP patients had a history of prior substance abuse vs 15% of non-APAP patients, and 14% had a specific history of injection drug use vs 8% for the non-APAP group.7 Understanding what determines these behaviors might lead to better identification of high-risk patients and development of prevention strategies.\\n\\nWith either intentional or unintentional etiologies, critical behavioral differences could lead to high-risk behaviors. Impulsivity is a character trait defined as “acting suddenly in an unplanned manner to satisfy a desire,” ie, not thinking things through to understand the potential impact of a decision. More recently, impulsivity has been recognized as a measurable trait that is correlated with a variety of addictive behaviors.8 We have recently shown that higher impulsivity scores on the Barratt impulsivity scale are detected in both intentional and unintentional APAP overdoses when compared with control populations (Sanders C, Lee WM, unpublished data, submitted for publication).'], hint: None\n",

We hypothesized that this polymorphism or others that are related may have an impact in patients with APAP overdoses, especially in patients who have multiple substance dependencies. Furthermore, we speculated that the genetic association may be stronger or more apparent in subjects with intentional APAP overdose compared with those with nonintentional overdose.

By using DNA from 229 of these APAP subjects, we sought to identify whether selective variants in genes related to stress/impulsivity and addiction are associated with APAP overdose cases, because these findings might shed light on the patients’ tendency to abuse APAP products.\\n\\nMethods\\nPatients'], hint: None\n",

Here, we briefly introduce the case of a patient with latent autoimmune diabetes who developed SPS through the action of subcutaneously injected insulin. A 43-year-old man was diagnosed with diabetes and initially well-controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents but progressed to requiring insulin within 1 year of diagnosis. Two months after the initiation of basal insulin therapy, he presented with abdominal stiffness and painful muscle spasms, involving the lower limbs, which resulted in walking difficulty, and thus, he refused insulin injections thereafter. He had been treated with oral anti-diabetic agents instead of insulin for 10 years until premixed insulin twice daily was started again due to poor diabetes control. Immediately after insulin injection, abdominal muscle rigidity and spasms were noted. When insulin was not administered, frequent episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis occurred. Serum GAD antibody test was positive and there was no positivity for islet antigen-2 antibody. A glucagon stimulation test demonstrated relative insulin deficiency, indicative of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA). Tolerable muscle rigidity was achieved when the dosage of basal insulin was split into two separate daily injections with lower amounts of units per injection.

      "Predicting with title: Exogenous Insulin Injection-Induced Stiff-Person Syndrome in a Patient With Latent Autoimmune Diabetes: A Case Report and Literature Review., context: ['Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a rare autoimmune neurological disorder and highly associated with glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody (GAD-Ab) positivity. Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the predominant inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. In the neuron, GABA is synthesized in the cytosol from its precursor glutamate by the enzyme glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) and then transported into the synaptic vesicles (1–3). The blockade of GAD, a critical enzyme involved in inhibitory pathways, and subsequent decline in the levels of GABA in the central nervous system have been suggested to be associated with a loss of neural inhibition, although evidence for a causative link between GAD antibodies and SPS pathogenesis is still lacking (1). GAD is the rate-limiting enzyme for the synthesis of GABA. SPS is characterized by progressive muscle stiffness, rigidity, and spasm involving the truncal and proximal limb muscles, resulting in severely impaired ambulation (4). It is suspected that the symptoms of SPS get precipitated by external stimuli, such as sounds, stress, and emotional upheaval (1, 5). The diagnosis of SPS is based on the detection of typical clinical findings, GAD antibody positivity, and suggestive ancillary investigations. GAD is also found in non-neuronal tissues, such as pancreatic beta cells, testes, and oviducts, so SPS is also associated with other endocrine disorders (6, 7). It has been shown that ~45% of patients with SPS have type 1 diabetes (T1D), which is an autoimmune disease characterized by the immune-mediated loss of the insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells (1, 5, 8, 9). SPS and T1D share human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genetic risk, with most SPS patients possessing the DQ2 phenotype (10). Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) shares clinical and metabolic characteristics with both T1D and type 2 diabetes (T2D). According to the criteria of LADA diagnosis, LADA is defined by the absence of insulin requirement for at least 6 months after diagnosis and exhibits an older age of onset, as well as a slower progression toward insulin dependence compared to subjects with T1D (11, 12). LADA in SPS is rarely described (13). Here, we reported a case of SPS in a patient with LADA. To our knowledge, this is the first report of SPS described shortly after the initiation of insulin therapy that required to split the administration of basal insulin into two separate injections (with lower amounts of insulin units per each injection) to achieve tolerable muscle symptoms and better glucose control, without the development of diabetic ketoacidosis.\\n\\nCase Report'], hint: None\n",

However, within 1 year, he was started on subcutaneous insulin injections (Insulatard, isophane Neutral Protamine Hagedorn human insulin, twice daily). Two months after the initiation of insulin therapy, he presented with abdominal stiffness, painful spasms extending to lower limbs, and impaired walking ability. Neurological examination showed muscle rigidity and bilateral contractures in the lower limbs but no muscular weakness. Electroencephalography was normal, and electromyography/nerve conduction velocity revealed slightly asymmetrical motor and sensory polyneuropathy with demyelination. These features were highly indicative of SPS. Therefore, diazepam (10 mg/day in two divided oral doses), clonazepam (2 mg orally four times daily), baclofen (10 mg two times daily), and phenobarbital (30 mg two times daily) were administered to treat muscle rigidity.\\n\\nThe patient's symptoms of jerky myoclonus-like movement, abdominal stiffness with painful spasms, and muscle rigidity were exacerbated by sound, anxiety, and subcutaneous insulin injections, regardless of the treatment regimen (Insulatard or regular insulin). Thus, he refused insulin therapy, resulting in poor glycemic control for 10 years, which resulted in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values persistently >8.0% (64 mmol/mol) with only oral anti-diabetic drugs (metformin 2,000 mg/day, sitagliptin 100 mg/day, glimepiride 8 mg/day, and acarbose 200 mg/day). Therefore, basal insulin (insulin glargine, 0.43 IU/Kg/day) with oral anti-diabetic agents (metformin 1,500 mg/day and gliclazide MR 240 mg/day) followed by premixed insulin twice daily (Humalog Mix 25, 0.71 IU/Kg/day) or a basal-bolus injection regimen (insulin detemir 0.17 IU/Kg/day and insulin aspart 0.13 IU/Kg/day) were introduced since 2015. He consistently experienced muscle rigidity with subcutaneous insulin injections every time. His fear and anxiety of re-experiencing muscle stiffness resulted in poor compliance with the prescribed therapeutic regimens. Finally, he experienced two episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis in 2017 (BMI was 22.45 kg/m2) and the laboratory results are summarized in Table 1. His GAD65-Ab level was positive (110 units/mL), insulin antibodies (IAs) were positive (13.7%), while islet antigen-2 (IA2) autoantibodies were within the normal range.

The presence of high-titers of GAD autoantibodies has been reported in more than 85% of patients with SPS (1, 14, 15). GAD is involved in the synthesis of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma aminobutyric acid in the central nervous system (CNS). Dysfunction of GABA input in motor neurons causes stiffness, rigidity, and painful spasms (16). GABAergic neuron dysfunction has also been reported in epilepsy, and 10% of patients with SPS have some form of epilepsy (1, 16). From preclinical and animal models, it has been hypothesized that autoimmune responses against GAD in pancreatic islet deplete this enzyme and reduce GABA levels within the GABAergic system in the endocrine pancreas, thus promoting the progression of T1D. Moreover, GABA has been shown to exert β-cell regenerative effects, protecting β-cells against apoptosis induced by cytokines, drugs, and other stresses, and exerting anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory effects (17). The GAD-Abs are believed to play a role in the possible relationship between epilepsy and T1D (18). Two major isoforms of GAD enzyme exist, namely GAD65, and GAD67, which catalyze the formation of GABA at different locations in the cell and different time periods of development. GAD65 is attached to the surface of synaptic vesicles in GABAergic neurons or microvesicles in the pancreatic beta-cells, while GAD67 is a soluble form detectable only in the CNS (19).

Taking into consideration the complexity of the case and the presence of proteinuria a renal biopsy was deemed necessary and documented mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis, thus, substantiating the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus flare. Pending the biopsy result, treatment with hydroxychloroquine and corticosteroids (equivalent of methylprednisolone 1\\u200amg/kg/day) was initiated. Due to failure to achieve remission, azathioprine was added, but symptoms persisted. Following the diagnosis of lupus nephritis, azathioprine was discontinued and induction treatment with cyclophosphamide in accordance with the Euro-Lupus regimen was initiated. Corticosteroids were tapered gradually. The patient responded after the first cycle of cyclophosphamide and was discharged after 40 days of hospitalization, but fever recurred five days before the 2nd cycle. A second hospitalization followed and after the third cycle there was no recurrence of the fever.

Nevertheless, the prolonged fever of the patient along with episodes of hypotension given the impaired autonomic system response in a context of high prevalence of nosocomial infections and increased antimicrobial resistance, mandated the use of broad spectrum antibiotics and the escalation of the antimicrobial treatment.\\n\\nThe work-up we undertook did not provide evidence to a neoplastic origin of this febrile syndrome, but clues to an auto-immune disorder. Fever as a manifestation of SLE occurs frequently but it rarely is the sole manifestation of SLE at presentation and frequently it responds to corticosteroids.[7] Given the deterioration in the clinical status and the proteinuria in the absence of other manifestations to substantiate the diagnosis coupled with the presence of anti-ds DNA antibodies,[8] we resorted to renal biopsy which corroborated the diagnosis of SLE in accordance with the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics classification criteria (SLICC).[9]\\n\\nSystemic lupus erythematosus is a multisystem autoimmune disease notorious for its protean manifestations,[10] whereas a definitive diagnosis of multiple system atrophy can only be made through brain biopsy.[2] Thus, we considered the possibility that the constellation of symptoms in our patient may be in part manifestations of systematic lupus erythematosus.[11] We believe that the clinical course of the patient spanning years before the flare, the lack of abnormal findings in the MRI of the patient and the lack of response of the neurological syndrome to a treatment regimen that induced and maintained long term remission reasonably exclude the possibility that the principal components of the neurological syndrome are associated with SLE.\\n\\nIn our literature search, we found no previous reports of co-existence of multiple system atrophy and systemic lupus erythematosus and current evidence do not seem to lend support to a shared pathogenesis.\\n\\nAuthor contributions\\nConceptualization: Dimitrios Pilalas, Georgia D.

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Non-Commercial, No Derivatives (CC BY-NC-ND) license.\\n\\nResistance to antipsychotic treatment is defined as failure to respond to two antipsychotics of adequate dose and duration1 and occurs in 30% of individuals with schizophrenia.2 Clozapine is the only medication with evidence-based effectiveness in treatment-resistant schizophrenia,1 being effective in 50–60% of cases,3 but is also associated with a broad range of adverse effects. A commonly accepted risk is clozapine-induced blood dyscrasia, typically neutropenia or agranulocytosis. Neutropenia is defined as a neutrophil count of less than 1.5×109/L, occurring at a rate of 2.7% of clozapine users at 1 year.4 Patients who develop neutropenia may develop flu-like symptoms such as sore throat and pyrexia, with the peak risk occurring at 6–18 weeks. Less common is agranulocytosis, a life-threatening event defined as a neutrophil count of less than 0.5×109/L, occurring in approximately 0.8% of clozapine users at 1 year.4\\n\\nDispensing of clozapine is dependent on a satisfactory full blood count (FBC) result and maintenance of normal white blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil counts during clozapine treatment. In established clozapine-induced neutropenia or agranulocytosis, clozapine is immediately discontinued, and given the increased risk of recurrence,5 re-challenge is contraindicated. However, re-challenge may be attempted under certain conditions, for example, due to an alternative cause of the reduced neutrophil count being identified, or after careful assessment of the clinical risks and benefits. This process involves collaboration with a haematologist and may involve the co-administration of lithium or granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCS-F) in an attempt to promote granulocyte proliferation and increase the WBC and neutrophil counts. Despite carefully controlled re-challenge, a third of patients will develop a further blood dyscrasia, which is often more rapid in onset and more severe.5\\n\\nIn this report, we add to the limited existing evidence of successfully re-challenging clozapine for a third time with a patient with treatment-resistant schizoaffective disorder, following two episodes of agranulocytosis and one of episode of neutropenia.\\n\\nCase report'], hint: None\n",

She was born and raised abroad before moving to the UK at the age of 21 years. J.B. first presented with psychotic symptoms at the age of 19 years. Over the next decade, she had multiple admissions to psychiatric hospitals, both informally and under Section 3 of the Mental Health Act. Her illness was characterised by mixed affective episodes associated with persecutory delusions, thought disorder and auditory hallucinations, often triggered by stress or periods of non-adherence to medication. During admission to our service, persecutory beliefs were about other patients, staff and visitors, and led to accusations of theft of her belongings, accusations of sexual assault and physical aggression. Periodically, she became suspicious about the side-effects of medications and declined to adhere to their administration. There was a significant labile component to her mood, fluctuating between laughing and verbal or physical aggression. Between episodes, J.B. was pleasant, engaged in recovery-oriented practices and appeared less preoccupied and distressed by positive psychotic symptoms.\\n\\nDuring the first 7 years of her illness, J.B. was treated with multiple antipsychotics (i.e. quetiapine, aripiprazole, risperidone, olanzapine, amisulpride, haloperidol, sulpiride, zuclopenthixol decanoate and flupentixol decanoate), mood stabilisers (lithium carbonate and sodium valproate) and a course of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) with minimal improvement documented in case notes.

At this time, she was also receiving quetiapine and sodium valproate. Pre-treatment FBC showed a WBC count of 5.8×109/L and a neutrophil count of 2.9×109/L. WBC and neutrophil counts remained within normal limits until week 17, when J.B. developed agranulocytosis with a nadir WBC count of 2.0×109/L and a neutrophil count of 0.41×109/L. The daily dose of clozapine was 300 mg, with a plasma clozapine concentration of 0.17 mg/dL. Clozapine was immediately stopped and olanzapine was commenced as an alternative. The blood dyscrasia persisted for 19 days in total before cell counts recovered. Case records from the previous hospital indicated a significant improvement in her clinical state with clozapine, and discontinuation was associated with a rapid increase in her psychotic symptoms.\\n\\nTrial 2\\nA second clozapine challenge was initiated in February 2012. Sodium valproate was discontinued prior to the second clozapine trial. At this time, J.B. was concurrently treated with olanzapine 10 mg and lithium carbonate 300 mg daily. An FBC prior to re-challenge with clozapine showed a WBC count of 8.0×109/L and a neutrophil count of 4.4×109/L. Six weeks after re-commencement of clozapine, J.B. developed a neutropenia, with a nadir neutrophil count of 0.53×109/L and a WBC of 1.9×109/L. Clozapine was immediately discontinued following consultation with a haematologist. The neutrophil count normalised over the next 20 days, during which time she was treated with an increased dose of olanzapine 15 mg and sulpiride 200 mg daily.\\n\\nTrial 3\\nIn September 2012, after a careful risk–benefit assessment and in collaboration with a haematologist, a third clozapine trial was commenced. On this occasion, J.B. was being treated with topiramate 400 mg and amisulpride 400 mg daily. She was commenced on weekly subcutaneous injections of GCS-F, with 480 mcg of filgrastim. After 18 weeks of treatment, she developed agranulocytosis with neutrophils dropping to 0.40×109/L and a WBC count of 2.6×109/L. By this time, clozapine had been titrated to 400 mg daily. Following consultation with a haematologist, J.B. continued clozapine treatment with an additional dose of filgrastim 480 mcg given that day. This resulted in a good response, with the neutrophil count increasing to 19.2×109/L and the WBC to 23.10×109/L the following day. A plan was formulated to increase the frequency of filgrastim injections to twice weekly in the event of further neutropenia; however, this was not required.

In October 2014, following specialist consultations, the multidisciplinary team agreed collaboratively with the patient and family to re-challenge with clozapine for a third time under close supervision. She was deemed to have capacity to be part of each of these decisions. Following consultation with a haematologist and pharmacist, lithium carbonate was commenced prior to clozapine initiation, and weekly FBCs were measured over the first year of clozapine treatment. It was planned that in the event of the neutrophil count dropping below 2×109/L, a single dose of 105 mcg of lenograstim was to be administered subcutaneously, and clozapine was to be continued with daily blood monitoring. In the event of the neutrophil count dropping below 1.5×109/L, a single dose of 105 mcg lenograstim was to be administered, and clozapine treatment immediately terminated. Lenograstim was to be used in preference to filgrastim because of increased experience with its use in our clinical setting.\\n\\nPre-treatment FBC demonstrated a WBC count of 8.43×109/L and a neutrophil count of 5.7×109/L. Standard clozapine titration was carried out as per Maudsley Guidelines,7 and clozapine was increased to a dose of 550 mg daily administered in liquid form. Lithium carbonate at 1200 mg daily was concurrently used, with serum lithium levels of 0.55–0.95 mmol/L attained. Weekly FBCs across the first year demonstrated stable WBC and neutrophil counts, with no episodes of neutropenia or the need for rescue lenograstim. Consistently, therapeutic plasma clozapine concentrations of around 0.35–0.40 mg/L were attained, without further haematological complications despite continuation of clozapine, and a dramatic improvement in mental state was observed.\\n\\nDiscussion\\nOwing to the severity and distressing nature of this young woman’s psychotic and mood symptoms and the lack of response to a number of antipsychotic medications, clozapine was re-challenged following specialist consultations and close monitoring practices. The results were promising given the failure of three previous attempts and thus support the need for measured re-challenging and augmentation practices. In a recent systematic review, clozapine re-challenge was successful in 70% (78/112 patients) after an episode of neutropenia, with 20% (3/15 patients) successfully re-challenged after agranulocytosis.8 The co-administration of lithium (33/35 patients) or GCS-F (7/11 patients), in a targeted strategy, decreased the likelihood of developing a further blood dyscrasia.8 We reported previously that a clozapine re-challenge was successful in 79% of patients (n=19) admitted to our service.9'], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: Successful clozapine re-challenge in a patient with three previous episodes of clozapine-associated blood dyscrasia., context: ['The effective treatment of schizoaffective disorder often requires the use of several psychopharmacological agents,10 and polypharmacy may have played a part in this case. The first trial of clozapine was concurrent with the use of sodium valproate. Sodium valproate can cause a dose-dependent inhibition of granulopoiesis,11 which when combined with clozapine may have led to the agranulocytosis. In the second trial, clozapine re-challenge occurred in combination with lithium carbonate. Lithium carbonate has demonstrated the ability to increase circulating neutrophils and granulocyte colony formation.12–14 Although a neutropenia occurred during this trial, it is interesting to note that the neutrophil count did not drop as low as seen in the first trial. During the third trial, J.B. was treated with concurrent G-CSF, and although agranulocytosis still occurred, neutrophil recovery was 1 day, which was significantly shorter than the recovery seen in the first and second trials. We are unable to explain this transient episode of agranulocytosis and the lack of any recurrent neutropenia over the following 7 months of clozapine treatment with concurrent G-CSF (with no G-CSF dose change). We cannot exclude that a transient increase in plasma clozapine concentrations was related to the onset of agranulocytosis (we have no data relating to plasma clozapine concentrations at that time, nor do we know if the patient had ceased smoking at or around this time). Alternatively, the presence of a viral infection may have contributed to the onset of agranulocytosis, though this was not clinically documented.\\n\\nDuring the fourth trial, lithium carbonate was used with therapeutic serum levels attained. Previous work has suggested that serum lithium levels greater than 0.4 mmol/L are required for granulopoiesis.14 Given the low dose of lithium carbonate used during the second trial, it may be that there were insufficient lithium levels to promote granulocyte colony formation at that time and that the optimal serum lithium levels in the fourth trial supported the maintenance of normal neutrophil counts.\\n\\nDespite neutropenia and agranulocytosis being well-documented complications of clozapine treatment, the mechanism of action remains unclear.15 There are several hypotheses, but due to its idiosyncratic nature it has been difficult to perform mechanistic studies to investigate these in a systematic fashion. Clozapine-induced agranulocytosis (CIA) has a large genetic component; genetic data suggest dysfunction in the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) system, which comprises genes that modulate immune system function. Recent work has suggested that there is an association with several genetic variants in the HLA-DQB1 locus, a single amino acid at HLA-DQB1 (126Q) and an amino acid change in the extracellular binding pocket of HLA-B (158T).16'], hint: None\n",

During the posttransplantation period, the patient experienced multiple complications of viral reactivation, including cytomegalovirus disease at 7 months treated with valganciclovir; BK virus (BKV) reactivation at month 9 without polyomavirus-associated nephropathy on biopsy leading to a reduction in the MMF dosage (500 mg twice a day); and Epstein-Barr virus viremia at month 16 with no signs of a posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder. Fourteen months after transplantation, he received pulsed intravenous corticosteroids for cellular rejection (grade Ib).

We found that the patient’s T cells expressed high levels of PD-1 up to day 61 (1 week before death) both ex vivo and after in vitro activation (Figure 2A). We then examined the effects of a neutralizing anti-PD-1 antibody (nivolumab) on T-cell proliferation in vitro. Programmed death-1 blockade failed to reverse this T-cell anergy (Figure 2B). Of interest, we tested in parallel a transplant recipient patient who had been receiving tacrolimus, MMF, and corticoids since November 2014. This patient developed BKV nephropathy along with BKV viremia (8.4 × 106 copies/mL) and was treated by replacing tacrolimus with everolimus (an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin) in April 2015. T lymphocytes from this patient were nonresponsive to BKV in vitro (Figure 2B) and expressed significant levels of PD-1 after BKV peptide activation (Figure 2A). In contrast to the PML patient on belatacept, who was refractory to PD-1 blockade, nivolumab significantly restored anti-BKV T-cell responsiveness in this second patient (Figure 2B).\\n\\nExpression of PD-1 and restoration of functionality after PD-1 neutralization is compatible with immune exhaustion [6]. Together, our findings suggested that chronic blockade of the CD28-B7 costimulatory pathway led to refractory anti-JCV T-cell anergy that persisted until the patient’s death, 2 months after belatacept withdrawal.'], hint: None\n",

Interleukin-7 induces widespread T-cell proliferation, increased T-cell numbers, and a more diverse T-cell receptor repertoire. We recently reported the case of a PML patient with profound lymphopenia after allogenic bone marrow transplantation, in whom r-hIL-7 led to the recovery of effective polyfunctional JCV-specific T-cell responses, virus clearance from CSF, and a favorable clinical outcome [7]. In this study, r-hIL-7 had no significant effect on the CD4 and CD8 T-cell counts. The subsequent CD4 cell recovery would be due more to MMF withdrawal. However, the CD8 T-cell count remained low. The patient had been on belatacept for 20 months, resulting in a long-term lack of CD28-mediated costimulation. Belatacept, which can provide significantly better renal function and both patient and renal graft survival than calcineurin inhibitor-based immunosuppression [8], provokes T-cell anergy in vivo [9]. The CD4 T-cell count recovery observed in our patient was not associated with improved functionality in terms of cytokine secretion, proliferation, or cytotoxicity. These functional abnormalities persisted for 60 days after PML diagnosis (the patient died 69 days after PML diagnosis) and were associated with strong expression of the inhibitory receptor PD-1. However, treatment with a therapeutic anti-PD1 receptor antibody (nivolumab) ex vivo failed to improve T-cell function.'], hint: None\n",

Although mucosal bleeding is the most common, fatal bleeding complications are also possible. Thus, F5D increases the difficulty of invasive testing, and surgical and procedural treatments. When long-term antithrombotic drugs, including antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants, are required in patients at high risk of bleeding, one of the biggest challenges is coronary intervention to treat coronary artery disease. Most studies recommend preinterventional or preoperative supplementation with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to reduce bleeding risk.[2,3] However, in addition to the bleeding risk caused by antithrombotic therapy, the hypercoagulable state in coronary intervention has an adverse effect on stent thrombosis, mortality, and prognosis during the postinterventional period.[4] The contemporary standard therapy for significant coronary artery stenosis is implanting a drug-eluting stent (DES). However, because implanting a DES delays endothelial healing and requires long-term antithrombotic therapy, DES implantation in an F5D patient is very complex. No antithrombotic therapy study to date has been reported for F5D patients undergoing coronary stenting.

She was not taking any medication except hypnotics, and her only cardiovascular risk factor was old age. Although she had had 3 natural childbirths, she had no history of surgery or blood transfusions. No specific findings were observed upon physical examination, electrocardiography (ECG), or chest x-ray imaging, and cardiac biomarkers were within the normal range, but the D-dimer, prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and activated PTT levels were prolonged. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a normal left ventricular ejection fraction and no regional wall motion abnormality.

FFP or platelet transfusion is recommended to control bleeding. In particular, transfusing FFP is recommended to maintain factor V activity at >25% to 30% in cases of bleeding, invasive testing, or surgery.[3,6] In this case, FFP was not transfused because coronary stenting was performed without knowledge of the degree of factor V activity or the existence of F5D. We recognized F5D due to hemoptysis, epistaxis, and hematochezia after coronary stenting. However, we first planned to reduce or modify the dosage of antithrombotic drugs due to the risk of stent thrombosis. This strategy was based on previous reports in which factor V activity was not related to bleeding severity.[2,6] Moreover, successful childbirth delivery was possible without an FFP transfusion, and the success rate for bleeding control was low with FFP transfusion.[3,6] Fortunately, mucosal bleeding in the present case was controlled by adjusting the antithrombotic drug dose. Treatments for the inhibitors or antibodies to factor V are another option and include plasmapheresis, immunosuppressants, steroids, intravenous globulins, and a monoclonal antibody.[2] Such therapies were not used in our case because the inhibitors and autoantibodies for factor V were unknown and such therapies have weak evidence.'], hint: None\n",

Clinically, it is characterized by severe cardiac arrhythmias including WPW syndrome, VT, and/or VF, dilated cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrest, and sudden death. Extra-cardiac features involving the nervous system and eyes have also been reported.4–7 DUFB11 variants have recently been independently proposed to cause histiocytoid cardiomyopathy. The efficacy of CA of PVCs triggering VF or polymorphic VT in idiopathic VF or channelopathies has been reported.2,3,8 Those PVCs could arise from the Purkinje system. Ablation therapy has also been reported in two cases of histiocytoid cardiomyopathy and VT, but the outcomes were far from satisfactory.9,10 The ablation target was the Purkinje tissue and anterior left bundle of His. One patient survived after a heart transplantation, and the other died of a cerebral haemorrhage after VAD therapy.9,10 Our case was a successful ablation of PVCs triggering TdP at the earliest ventricular sites. The patient died of uncontrolled heart failure due to cardiomyopathy 2 months later as a result.\\n\\nThe mechanism of ScTdP remains unclear, but it is assumed to be an unstable re-entry in the Purkinje network or triggered activity in the Purkinje cells. Histiocytoid cells are thought to correspond to abnormal Purkinje cells.11 In the case presented here, abnormal cells were occupying the subendocardium areas in both ventricles, while no fibrotic tissues were observed in those areas. Based on the pathological and electrophysiological findings, the PVCs were likely caused by triggered activity and associated with abnormal Purkinje cells. The perpetuation of the VT could have been caused by re-entry in the injured Purkinje network, because ablation of the narrow area in the RV suppressed the TdP.\\n\\nParticular attention should be given to the safety of CA in small patients. The expert consensus for CA is that VT with a deteriorating ventricular function is a Class I indication, even in infants, if medical therapy is not effective.1 We applied radiofrequency energy for 60\\u2009s for a total of 14 times at two different sites with the temperature control set below 55°C and a power limit of 30\\u2009W.

In all series germ cell tumors represent the most common histology (60%) [2]. The peak incidence of germ cell tumors is in the second decade [3]. In contrast to the other tumors mentioned which have no sex preference, germ cell tumors are more frequent in men than in women [1]. First symptoms are often neurological signs and complaints caused by an obstructive hydrocephalus with headache, nausea, and vomiting and/or involvement of ocular pathways. Determination of histology, tumor markers in serum and CSF, and extent of disease are critical for optimal management of pineal region tumors. Five year survival rates following radiation range from 44 - 78% and depend on extent of disease, age, radiation volume and dose to the primary site but primarily on histology [4]. The five year survival of patients with germinoma is 76% as compared with 21% for those with a \"non-germinomatous\" germ cell tumor. \\n\\nThere is no established therapy for relapsing or refractory intracranial germinoma. In analogy to germinomas of the testis a higher curability may be expected with high dose chemotherapy followed by autologous blood stem-cell retransfusion [5]. For non germinomatous tumors no guidelines exist with respect to dosage, combination or sequence of chemotherapy and radiation.\\n\\nCase presentation\\nA 25-year old man became symptomatic by diabetes insipidus.

A 62-year-old male patient presented with heart failure after experiencing a long period of unexplained and untreated gastrointestinal symptoms. Clinical examination and laboratory findings indicated a systemic process with cardiac involvement. Echocardiography revealed concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with enhanced echogenicity and preserved ejection fraction. Rectum biopsy confirmed amyloid deposition. The side effect of delayed diagnosis on prognosis and the appropriate diagnostic strategy has been discussed.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nLight-chain (AL) amyloidosis is a disorder characterized by deposition of insoluble, monoclonal immunoglobulin light-chain fragments in various tissues. Clinical features depend on organs involved but can include restrictive cardiomyopathy, nephrotic syndrome, hepatic failure, and peripheral/autonomic neuropathy. The patients often have a long period of a certain organ involved before systemic multiorgan involvement or heart failure has already developed. Cardiac involvement is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, especially in AL amyloidosis.1 Once congestive heart failure occurs in AL amyloidosis, median survival is less than 6 months if left untreated. Thus, an early and accurate diagnosis with an earlier start or more intensive treatment may have resulted in a better outcome.\\n\\nCase report\\nA 62-year-old male presented with a 15-day history of dyspnea on exertion, associated with both lower extremity edema. Before this admission, he also had suffered from abdominal bloating and tasteless for a year with noticeable body weight loss at the same time (up to 20 kg). Over the past 6 months, he developed a multiple system disorder, which included painless paresthesias in the lower limbs, erectile dysfunction, and chronic diarrhea. He had an average stool frequency of up to ten times per day, with no obvious blood or mucus and no abdominal pain or tenesmus. Unfortunately, previous stomach and rectum biopsy did not examine for accumulations of amyloid fibril protein. His family history was unremarkable.\\n\\nOn physical examination, his blood pressure was 82/56 mmHg and heart rate was 52 bpm. Significant jugular venous distention, moderate hepatomegaly, and lower extremity edema were noted. A neurological examination revealed weakness and muscular atrophy in the bilateral tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius. Hyporeflexia was noted on both knees and ankles.

N-terminal fragment of pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) was 3,996 pg/mL. Nerve conduction studies confirmed bilateral sensory-motor neuropathy (Table 1). An electromyography study demonstrated active denervation and chronic reinnervation changes in the tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius. Electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed sinus rhythm, low voltages in limb leads, QS waves in precordial and inferior leads, first-degree atrioventricular block, and prolonged QTc (Figure 1). Two-dimensional echocardiography revealed marked concentrically thickened and speckled appearance of ventricular walls, biatrial dilatation, and left ventricular ejection fraction of 70% (Figure 2).

The major types of amyloidosis, classified on the basis of their precursor protein, include light-chain, senile systemic (wild-type transthyretin), hereditary (mutant transthyretin), and secondary (AA) diseases. The frequency of cardiac involvement varies among the types of amyloidosis and is common with AL disease.2 Myocardial amyloid involvement leads to a restrictive cardiac physiology with possible concomitant conduction system disease, and the patients may present with nonspecific dyspnea, lower extremity edema, and syncope.

Echocardiographic findings include biatrial dilatation and increased left ventricular wall thickness with diastolic dysfunction. Ejection fraction is generally preserved. These findings are also prevalent in other cardiac conditions such as hypertrophic nonobstructive cardiomyopathy. However, ECG of our patient revealed low voltages, which was not typical for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Increased myocardial echogenicity with a granular or sparkling appearance is the most characteristic feature, as seen in the case. But this feature has limited sensitivity in cardiac amyloidosis and may be more indicative of late-stage disease. Advanced echocardiographic techniques are beginning to reveal more about the underlying pathology and functional abnormalities. With the tissue Doppler imaging technique, measurement of myocardial tissue velocity allows detection of early diastolic wall motion abnormalities before development of heart failure. However, a limitation of tissue Doppler imaging lies in its inability to distinguish between actively contracting myocardium and adjacent tethered akinetic myocardial segments. This limitation can be overcome by strain and strain rate imaging, which derives from speckle tracking imaging and is better able to distinguish among segmental wall motion differences.3 It is particularly helpful and demonstrates a very typical pattern in cardiac amyloidosis, characterized by relative sparing of apical longitudinal contraction compared to basal contraction. This appearance is not typically seen in other cardiomyopathies such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and aortic stenosis.\\n\\nThe use of a combination of echocardiographic and electrocardiographic features increases specificity. A low voltage on the ECG and increased septal and posterior left ventricle wall thickness on the echocardiogram are highly specific for cardiac amyloidosis in the setting of biopsy-proven systemic amyloidosis. Low QRS voltages (all limb leads <5 mm in height) with poor R-wave progression in the chest leads (pseudoinfarction pattern) occur in up to 50% of patients with cardiac AL amyloidosis, and this is the most common finding in affected individuals. Ischemic cardiomyopathy may also result in decreased voltages and infarction pattern on ECG but leads to dilated, eccentric ventricular hypertrophy with reduced ejection fraction.

There are two types of amyloid that commonly infiltrate the nerve system. The first is familial amyloid polyneuropathy (also known as hereditary amyloidosis).6 The second is AL amyloidosis. Peripheral neuropathy occurs in 17% of patients with AL amyloidosis, making it the most common type of acquired amyloid polyneuropathy. Sensory-motor axonal polyneuropathy and carpal tunnel syndrome are the most common types of neuropathy associated with AL amyloidosis. Symptoms typically begin with painful paresthesias in the feet signifying small fiber involvement. As the disease progresses, it can affect larger nerve fibers and patients may complain of numbness and motor weakness.7 Up to 65% of patients with peripheral neuropathy also have autonomic nervous system involvement. The clinical manifestations of autonomic disorders are nonspecific and symptoms can include nausea, vomiting, early satiety, bloating, constipation, diarrhea, postural lightheadedness, and erectile dysfunction. Due to varying clinical symptoms, the diagnosis of amyloid neuropathy is often a challenge. However, it is important to recognize and distinguish neuropathy from diseases of the end organs themselves. Diagnostic testing can include electromyography/nerve conduction studies, autonomic function tests.8 In this case, early diagnosis is particularly crucial so that patients might undergo the appropriate testing to find cardiac involvement in early stage.

However many studies suggest different systemic effects related to PHPT, which could be enhanced by an abnormal cortisol release due to chronic stress of hyperparathyroidism. Being PHPT frequently found in the 6(th) to 7(th) decade of life, a careful and multifaceted approach should be taken.\\n\\n\\nMETHODS\\nWe report the case of an elderly patient with symptomatic PHPT and incidental pulmonary embolism. He was treated with hydration, zoledronic acid, cinacalcet and high-dose unfractionated heparin. Parathyroid surgery was successfully performed, but patient's conditions suddenly worsened because of a transient thyrotoxicosis, probably induced by a previous exposure to iodine load and/or thyroid surgical manipulation. A short-term treatment with beta-blockers was introduced for symptomatic relief. The patient also presented a transient hypercortisolism with elevated ACTH, likely due to stress related not only to aging and hospitalization but also to PHPT, resolved only four months after parathyroid surgery.\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nChronic hyperparathyroidism has been linked with increased all-cause mortality. A functional chronic hypercortisolism could be established, enhancing PHPT related disorders. Only parathyroid surgery has been demonstrated to cure PHPT and complications related, showing similar outcome between older and younger patients. However, the management of post-operative period should be more careful in fragile patients. In particular, the early diagnosis and treatment of a transient post-operative thyrotoxicosis could improve recovery. Due to the increase in prevalence and the evidence of many related complications even in asymptomatic PHPT, expert opinion-based guidelines for surgical treatment of PHPT should be developed especially for elderly patients.\\n\\nBackground\\nPrimary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is the third most common endocrinopathy seen today, frequently found in the 6th to 7th decade of life. PHPT mainly is a sporadic disorder, caused in 85% of the cases by a single adenoma, in 15% by multi-gland disease and rarely by parathyroid carcinoma. Less than 10% of cases are inheritable, often associated with multi-gland hyperplasia. The most common presentation of PHPT is an asymptomatic hypercalcemia, incidentally found on routine blood tests. However, many patients may suffer from minimal symptoms such as asthenia, constipation, polyuria, hypertension and neuro-psychiatric complications [1]. In some cases a renal colic is the first presentation of the disease. In older patients, concomitant morbidity and poly-pharmacotherapy may worsen symptoms and complications, and impact the management of PHPT [2].\"], hint: None\n",

Bisphosphonate administration was effective in reducing calcium levels and bone resorption, in particular recent controlled trials demonstrated the superiority of zoledronate compared with previous treatments [3]. The addition of cinacalcet may be useful in the elderly or in not-surgical candidates, being well tolerated [4]. Parathyroid surgery is the only definite cure for PHPT, but the risks and benefits of surgery should be extensively considered in the elderly, given their more fragile state and co-morbidities [5].

The first condition is fairly unknown and underestimated since the symptoms could be masked by other postoperative events [6]. Thyrotoxicosis seems to be related to an increased release of thyroid hormones and/or autoantigen during surgical manipulation, which could reactivate underlying autoimmune thyroiditis [7]. It could be influenced by other mechanisms, like preoperative hypercalcemic setting, pre-existing goiter and difficult parathyroid glands identification during surgical exploration [8]. Our patient had an euthyroid goiter, without abnormal MIBI-uptake in preoperative investigations nor previous or underlying autoimmune thyroiditis.

This phenomenon, known as the Jod-Basedow effect, usually develops over 2 to 12\\xa0weeks, typically in old patients with underlying thyroid disease or living in areas of iodine deficiency. Exposure to a large iodine load can also cause acute destructive thyroiditis in people without pre-existing thyroid disorders [9]. TcO4-scintigraphy could not discriminate the cause of hyperthyroidism, since pertechnetate is trapped by thyroid, but not organified and the resulting tracer uptake may be reduced. As happened in our case, the assessment of urinary iodine concentration may be helpful [10]. Some researchers have investigated the incidence and the role of prophylactic measures to reduce the risk of iodine-induced thyrotoxicosis, without conclusive findings [11]. In our case the concomitant neck surgery could have been a precipitating factor in the pathogenesis of hyperthyroidism.\\n\\nBoth these conditions are usually self-limited and anti-thyroid drugs are not indicated. However, a short-term treatment with beta-blockers could be required for symptomatic relief, especially in fragile patients.\\n\\nSince chronic hyperparathyroidism has been linked with increased all-cause mortality, in asymptomatic and elderly patients the optimal timing for parathyroidectomy is controversial [12].

The complexity of PTH functions is further highlighted by data suggesting a bidirectional link between PTH and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system, playing a synergic role in enhancing metabolic and cardiovascular complications [15]. Several studies have also evidenced an altered hypotalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in PHPT, potentially contributing to cortical bone damage [16]. In vitro evidence supports a stimulatory effect of PTH on cortisol secretion [17] and of calcemia on ACTH release [18]. In vivo data show a hypercortisolism, loss of circadian rhythm and lack of cortisol suppression after low-dose DST in PHPT [19], which are not always recovered after surgical cure, as happened in our case.\\n\\nAlteration of cortisol expression and its circadian variability are also typical of aging, hospitalization, psychiatric and stress conditions [20]. False-positive results of the 1\\xa0mg DST could be influenced by absorption, liver or renal alterations and the use of alcohol or drugs inducing CYP3A4. Being PHPT a long-standing disease frequently affecting old patients, the activation of adrenal function seems to recall a functional hypercortisolism due to chronic stress, which could be preserved by aging and other co-morbidities, enhancing the damaging effects of prolonged exposure to stress hormones [21].'], hint: None\n"

With rapid advancements in next generation sequencing technologies, there is more focus on HIV drug-resistant variants of low frequency, or the so-called minority variants. In South Africa, AZT monotherapy for pMTCT, similar to World Health Organization option A, has been used since 2008. In 2010, a single dose of co-formulated TDF/FTC was included in the strategy for prevention of resistance conferred by single-dose nevirapine (sd NVP). The study was conducted in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, among pMTCT participants who received AZT monotherapy from 14 weeks of gestation, intrapartum AZT and sd NVP, and postpartum sd TDF/FTC. Twenty-six specimens collected at 6 weeks post-delivery were successfully sequenced using 454 ultra-deep sequencing. Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) resistance was detected in 17 of 26 (65%) patients, 2 (7%) had Thymidine analogue mutations, and 3 (11%) had K65R. Of the 17 patients with NNRTI resistance, 11 (65%) had high-level NNRTI resistance, whereas 6 (35%) had intermediate NNRTI resistance. The levels of NNRTI resistance are much higher than would be expected, given the inclusion of antepartum AZT and postpartum TDF/FTC. This high level of NNRTI resistance could impact future NNRTI-containing treatment for a large proportion of pMTCT-exposed women. The detection of Thymidine analogue mutations highlights the need to understand the clinical impact of these on AZT-containing antiretroviral treatment in women exposed to AZT monotherapy.\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\nAlthough prevention of mother-to-child transmission (pMTCT) strategies have recently improved with the implementation of World Health Organization (WHO) options B and B plus,1 antiretroviral (ARV) drug resistance remains a significant problem in the wake of single-dose nevirapine (sd NVP)2,3 monotherapy and dual-therapy use in resource-limited settings. The current standard method for resistance testing is Sanger sequencing, or so-called population sequencing, and although widely used, it is limited since the sensitivity relies on mutations being present in 15%–20% of the HIV quasispecies.4,5 Thus, resistance conferring mutations present at low frequencies, or drug-resistant minority variants (DRMVs) will be missed by Sanger sequencing. The more sensitive technologies, commonly known as next-generation sequencing, include the Miseq and HiScan (Illumina, San Diego, CA), 454 GS-FLX and Junior (Roche Daignostics, Basel, Switzerland), Pac-Bio RS II (Pacific Biosciences, CA), and Ion-Torrent PGM (Life Technologies, Thermo Fischer Scientific, NY). Resistance testing performed using these technologies can detect DRMVs present at low frequencies.6 These DRMVs were shown to be clinically significant in studies investigating non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor–based ART.7,8 DRMVs doubled the risk of virological failure to first-line NNRTI-containing antiretroviral treatment (ART).9'], hint: None\n",

If the virus reactivates in the trigeminal ganglia, it can cause varicella zoster ophthalmicus, which can have severe ocular complications. We report a case of a 73-year-old woman in severe immunosuppression due to treatment with mycophenolate mofetil, glucocorticosteroids and a tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitor. The reactivation caused superior orbital fissure syndrome, which has only rarely been described in relation to varicella zoster virus reactivation. In our case, the syndrome was seen along with severe encephalitis.\\n\\nBackground\\nThe incidence of varicella zoster virus (VZV) reactivation is increased in immunosuppressed patients, and reactivation of herpes zoster is a common adverse event reported in clinical trials with tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitors (TNF-alpha) [1].\\n\\nVaricella zoster ophthalmicus (VZO) is caused by reactivation of latent virus in the trigeminal ganglion, and ocular complications may include blepharitis, keratoconjunctivitis, iritis, scleritis and acute retinal necrosis [2]. Another ophthalmological complication is ophthalmoplegia, which can be seen in relation to VZO, and there is a slight increase in simultaneous aseptic meningitis when VZO is accompanied by ophthalmoplegia [3].\\n\\nSuperior orbital fissure syndrome (SOFS) is rare in relation to VZO, but a closely related entity named orbital apex syndrome (OAS) has been correlated with the occurrence of VZO; however, only in a few cases [2,4]. In SOFS, there is no lesion to the optic nerve in contrast to OAS, in which the optic nerve is compromised, leading to reduced visual acuity [5].\\n\\nCase Presentation\\nA 73-year-old woman with active pyoderma gangrenosum was treated with both mycophenolate mofetil and glucocorticoids for years. Due to worsening of her skin condition, she began a series of treatments with infliximab, a TNF-alpha inhibitor. She received 400 mg intravenous treatment on two occasions 14 days apart. Approximately 4 weeks after her last treatment, she started complaining of severe, right-sided, retrobulbar pain and was evaluated by an ophthalmologist. The examination only revealed slight periorbital edema.\\n\\nSeven days later, she was admitted with near-complete ophthalmoplegia of her right eye; dilated, fixed pupil; near-complete ptosis; severe, retrobulbar pain; prominent edema of the periorbital surroundings on both sides, and a feeling of altered sensibility in the area of the first trigeminal branch on the right side. The ophthalmoplegia and ptosis became complete within 12 h of admission. She complained of slightly impaired vision on her right eye, but ophthalmological reevaluation revealed full visual acuity in the affected eye. No skin vesicles were noticed, but the fluorescein test of her right eye showed diffuse uptake (fig. 1).'], hint: None\n",

Only a few days later, her left eye also became ophthalmoplegic with fixed, dilated pupil. Ophthalmological examination revealed normal tension, clear anterior chamber and bilateral well-defined optic discs.\\n\\nDuring the admission, the patient's condition deteriorated. She became progressively encephalopathic and then unconscious. The patient died during assessment of complications related to her encephalopathy.\\n\\nDifferential Diagnosis and Tests\\nAt the initial workup, a computed tomography scan of the cerebrum including cerebral angiography was performed and found to be normal. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan with intravenous contrast and MRI venous angiography was carried out, revealing meningeal enhancement in the posterior fossa and the area around the cerebellopontine angle on the right side (fig. 2). This was strongly suspicious of basal meningitis, and a lumbar puncture showed 114 white blood cells with 96% being of lymphocytic origin. The cerebrospinal fluid was considered free of malignant cells and bacteria, but positive for VZV DNA on polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A PCR of the fluid from the right eye was also positive for VZV.\\n\\nTreatment\\nFrom the time of admission, the patient received intravenous treatment with acyclovir initially 750 mg three times per day, but the dosage of acyclovir was increased to 1,000 mg three times per day once the PCR for herpes virus family came back positive for VZV. She continued on an unaltered oral dosage of prednisone at 15 mg per day.\\n\\nDiscussion\\nReactivation of herpes zoster is more likely to happen in patients with compromised cell-mediated immunity as a result of i.e. common aging, the use of immunosuppressive therapies, or concomitant illness. The severity of the zoster outbreak is correlated with the degree of immunoincompetence [6].\\n\\nMcDonald et al. [7] found a significantly higher risk of herpes zoster in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with TNF-alpha inhibitors compared with those treated with, i.e., sulfasalazine. The patients treated with TNF-alpha inhibitors, who developed herpes zoster, were subdivided into three groups, and a significantly higher risk was associated with the use of infliximab compared to etanercept and adalimumab. Another retrospective study showed significantly greater risk when using infliximab and adalimumab compared with no TNF-alpha inhibitor treatment [8].\"], hint: None\n",

[9] described a patient treated with mycophenolate mofetil who developed hemi-cauda equina syndrome due to varicella zoster meningoradiculitis. However, this patient also had renal function impairment, which is known to increase the risk of VZV reactivation [10]. The study by Koo et al. [11] on the incidence of herpes zoster reactivation in patients after heart transplantation showed treatment with mycophenolate mofetil as an independent risk factor for herpes zoster. Using glucocorticoids has also been shown to have a significant association with varicella zoster reactivation [12].\\n\\nSOFS consists of dysfunction of the oculomotor nerve (III), the trochlear nerve (IV), the abducens nerve (VI) and the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve (V1). If there is involvement of the optical nerve (II) as well, it is called OAS. The causes of both SOFS and OAS are many, i.e. inflammation, infection, neoplasia, iatrogenic, trauma and vascular conditions [5].\\n\\nThe ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve is purely sensory. It supplies the cornea, the skin of the forehead, eyelid and nose, and it gives off branches to the tentorium cerebelli, dura mater and the posterior area of the falx cerebri [4], possibly explaining a way for the virus to reach the brain causing encephalitis and meningitis.\\n\\nThe pathogenesis of OAS in relation to VZO is thought to be related to immune complexes, direct tissue infection with the virus and/or secondary vasculitis [4]. The same is likely to be true for the SOFS when it occurs in relation to VZO.\\n\\nFollowing reactivation of VZV in the ganglion and the spread along the first branch of the trigeminal nerve, direct tissue infection and an immune response may take place within the orbit. The immune response is both humoral and cellular, resulting in inflammation with clinical manifestations of pain, hyperemia, edema, heat and loss of function. It is mediated by the release of lipid mediators, cytokines and altered vascular permeability. The involvement of orbital tissue ipsilateral to cutaneous lesions supports the notion that the pathogenesis is likely to be due to direct viral infection in the orbital cells and a consequent immune system reaction. Circulating immune complex-mediated mechanisms could, however, potentially involve the contralateral orbital tissue resulting in the same symptoms [4], explaining the involvement of the other eye in our patient.\\n\\nThe viral replication of VZV is of short duration and confined to the early stage of the disease. Antiviral therapies should be administered early to have an effect.

Belatacept selectively inhibits T cell activation and was recently demonstrated to be superior to cyclosporin in patients with renal transplants in terms of renal function with equivalent survival[2]. Frequent adverse events associated with belatacept are anemia, disturbance of bowel habits and infections, especially urinary tract infections, with no need to stop treatment in most of cases. Here, we report a case of severe stricturing Crohn’s disease (CD)-like colitis due to belatacept administration in a renal transplant recipient.\\n\\nCASE REPORT\\nWe report the case of a 62-year-old man who received a first kidney allograft from a deceased donor in September 2013. His end-stage renal disease was attributed to chronic glomerulonephritis. After an induction treatment by thymoglobulin and methylprednisolone pulses, the immunosuppression regimen consisted of tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and steroids. There was no immediate complication after transplantation and the nadir of serum creatinin was 2.24 mg/dL. Rapidly, after two months, tacrolimus was withdrawn due to nephrotoxicity (histologically proven) and replaced with everolimus which was also stopped due to development of lymphocele and proteinuria. In February 2014, belatacept was started at a dose of 5 mg/kg intravenously every month in association with mycophenolate mofetil in order to decrease corticosteroids to the level of 10 mg/d.\"], hint: None\n",

In October 2015, because of worsening of the diarrhea, a stool culture was performed which was positive for Campylobacter jejuni. Antibiotics course was prescribed with some efficacy but the diarrhea persisted.\\n\\nIn February 2016, the patient was hospitalized for bloody stools with anemia and abdominal pain for which blood transfusion was necessary. A colonoscopy was rapidly performed showing large round shaped deep ulcers with normal surrounding mucosa. These ulcers were located in the caecum, transverse colon, left colon and sigmoid colon and were compatible with the diagnosis of CD (Figure 1). The terminal ileum and rectum were normal. Histologic examination of the colonic biopsies showed acute colitis with ulcerations, crypt abscesses, lymphocytes and neutrophil polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration.

A follow-up colonoscopy was performed in June 2016 which showed persistence of the large ulcers previously described and the appearance of a passable ulcerated inflammatory stricture at the left colonic flexure (Figure 1). Histologic examination showed acute colitis without signs of chronic inflammation (Figure 2). No signs of cytomegalovirus colitis were found on histology, such as owl’s eye inclusion bodies. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of colonic biopsies was positive for human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6) and negative for cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus. Also, PCR analysis for cytomegalovirus in the blood was negative. Belatacept was therefore withdrawn in June 2016 and the patient was treated with low dose tacrolimus for prevention of allograft rejection and an increased dose of steroids to treat colonic inflammation. In October 2016, the patient was free from diarrhea but described left-sided abdominal pain with partial obstructive symptoms probably due to the colonic stricture. The colonoscopy performed four months after belatacept withdrawal showed a complete healing of the ulcers in the left colon and a non-inflammatory stricture of the left colonic flexure which could not be passed (Figure 1). The stricture was not dilated as clinical symptoms were mild. PCR for HHV-6 was negative on colonic biopsies and only slightly positive on biopsies targeted to the colonic stricture. At the last clinical outpatient visit in January 2017 the patient was asymptomatic with no signs of acute renal rejection.\\n\\nDISCUSSION\\nWe have described here for the first time the case of a severe stricturing CD-like colitis occurring in a patient with a kidney allograft treated with belatacept. Gastrointestinal side effects are well known in renal transplant recipients receiving immunosuppressive therapy, especially mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). Indeed, MMF has multiple side effects and those affecting the gastrointestinal tract mostly occur during the first 6 mo after the onset of treatment[3]. These side effects include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, whereas bleeding is less reported. A recent retrospective study investigated endoscopic findings in patients treated with MMF having diarrhea. In most of the cases the colonic mucosa was normal and the common lesion was simple erythema without deep ulcer or stricture[3]. Our patient had diarrhea after introduction of MMF with liquid stools but no bleeding, and this diarrhea improved after MMF withdrawal. Although acute colitis was first thought to be due to MMF, appearance of bleeding, large ulcers without erythema at colonoscopy and worsening of endoscopic lesions after MMF withdrawal led us to suspect the involvement of belatacept.'], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: Stricturing Crohn's disease-like colitis in a patient treated with belatacept., context: ['Ipilimumab and tremelimumab, two therapeutic monoclonal antibodies against CTLA-4 and prescribed in cancer patients, have previously been implicated in the development of severe and extensive forms of inflammatory bowel disease with colonic ulcerations[4]. CTLA-4 is a homologue of CD28 that binds CD80 and CD86 with higher affinity, and thereby down-regulates T cell activation. Anti CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies block its interaction with CD80 and CD86 and favour CD28 engagement and consequently T cell activation and proliferation. The overactivation of the immune system in patients treated with anti CTLA-4 antibodies associated with a specific gut microflora may explain the development of treatment-mediated CD-like colitis[5]. Abatacept and belatacept are two recombinant fusion proteins comprising a fragment of the Fc domain of human IgG1 and the extracellular domain of human CTLAA-4. Similar to CTLA-4, abatacept and belatacept compete with CD28 for CD80 and CD86 binding to block co-stimulatory signaling, thus selectively modulating T-cell activation. In comparison to abatacept, belatacept confers higher affinity for CD 80/86 ligands and has a slower dissociation rates. It could also alter regulatory T cell development, which plays an important part in intestinal inflammation. Abatacept is effective for rheumatoid arthritis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis[6], and belatacept is currently used for kidney transplant rejection prophylaxis[1]. It has been showed that abatacept was not effective for the treatment of active ulcerative colitis and CD[6]. It may be surprising that belatacept induces CD-like colitis given it has the opposite effect from anti-CTLA-4 antibodies. However, cases of colitis have been also described in patients treated with abatacept (Table 1). A first case of ulcerative colitis was reported in 2006 in a 55 year old male patient treated with abatacept for rheumatoid arthritis[7]. The diagnosis of ulcerative colitis was made 15 mo after start of abatacept and digestive symptoms improved after abatacept withdrawal and mesalamine treatment. Two other cases of ulcerative colitis developing five and 23 mo after abatacept introduction in rheumatoid arthritis patients were reported. The first one was treated with mesalamine and infliximab and the second one with prednisolone and mesalamine[8]. Similarly to these case reports, the severe colitis occurred 23 mo after belatacept introduction in our patient. Macroscopically, the endoscopic lesions were more in favor of CD compared to abatacept-induced colitis, and the large deep ulcerations were similar to anti CTLA-4 enterocolitis. The histological findings in our patients described acute colitis with polymorph leucocyte infiltration and crypt abscesses without atrophy, distortion, branching or budding of crypts. These findings were also described in abatacept and anti CTLA-4 colitis. The most striking finding in our case is the development on belatacept treatment of an inflammatory stricture of the left colon. After belatacept withdrawal and pre'], hint: None\n",

It may be a direct effect of belatacept, which could alter the development of regulatory T cells, and therefore lead to uncontrolled intestinal inflammation. Another hypothesis may be an indirect effect of belatacept which confers a profound immunosuppression leading to the development of infectious colitis. Cytomegalovirus colitis was ruled out by careful histologic examination and negative PCR analyses in the blood and in colonic biopsies. PCR in biopsies was however, strongly positive for HHV-6. HHV-6 reactivation in patients with solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been reported to be associated with intestinal disease[9,10]. Moreover, HHV-6 was found in colonic mucosa of inflammatory bowel disease patients in 44% of the cases and associated with disease activity and use of immunosuppressive therapy[11]. HHV-6 intensity also correlated with endoscopic severity in ulcerative colitis. After belatacept withdrawal and mucosal healing, PCR for HHV-6 in colonic biopsies was found to be negative or slightly positive in our patient.\\n\\nThus, we report here a case of CD-like colitis in a patient treated with belatacept. Despite belatacept withdrawal, the patient developed a severe colonic stricture which may impact quality of life and necessitate subsequent colonic surveillance. Therefore in patients treated with belatacept who develop digestive symptoms such as diarrhea or intestinal bleeding, we recommend performing early colonoscopy and considering belatacept withdrawal in case of suggestive endoscopic and histologic findings.\\n\\nCOMMENTS\\nCase characteristics'], hint: None\n",

Recent advances in multiplex genotyping based on circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) provide a strong and non-invasive alternative for detection of the resistance mechanism.\\n\\n\\nMETHODS\\nHere we report a multiple metastatic NSCLC patient who was detected to have pure EGFR 19 exon deletion (negative for EML4-ALK and ROS1 in both IHC-based and sequencing assay) in the primary lesion and responded to first-line and second-line EGFR-TKI treatments (erlotinib then HY-15772). At 8 months, most lesions remained well controlled except for the liver metastases which presented dramatic progression. Considering the high risk of bleeding in rebiopsy of hepatic lesions, we conducted a multiplex genomic profiling with ctDNA. Results reported coexistence of EGFR mutation and EML4-ALK gene translocation in plasma which heavily indicated that ALK was the primary reason for progression of the liver lesions. This deduction was supported by the repeated response to ALK inhibitors (crizotinib then AP26113) of the hepatic metastases.\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nThis is the first report of the existence of ALK rearrangement in metastatic lesions in an EGFR mutated patient. It highlighted the feasibility and advantages of using ctDNA multiplex genotyping in identifying the heterogeneity across lesions and the resistance mechanism of targeted treatments.\\n\\nBackground\\nAdvances in geno-typing have changed the clinical practice of treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), especially non-squamous types where driver mutations, e.g. epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations and echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (EML4-ALK) translocation are commonly present. Agents that target EGFR activating mutations (gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib, etc.) or ALK rearrangement (crizotinib, etc.) derive significantly greater benefits than cytotoxic chemotherapy in patients who harbor these gene alterations, which is consistently proved by extensive large-scale randomized controlled trials [1, 2]. In order to deliver an appropriate first-line treatment regimen, detection of EGFR mutation and ALK rearrangement are recommended as routine genetic profiling for non-squamous NSCLC or non-smoking populations [3]. In recent years, some selective inhibitors that can overcome the resistance to first generation inhibitors of these driver alterations have also been developed, e.g., AZD9291 and CO-1686, some more effective inhibitors against both EGFR sensitizing and resistance T790M mutations [4]; or ceretinib, aletinib and AP26113, the agents that are effective for both ALK fusion and some secondary gatekeeper mutations [5].'], hint: None\n",

FISH, RT-PCR and Ventana IHC are all currently accepted methods for detection of ALK rearrangement. In recent years, the development and advances in high throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS) have allowed the simultaneous profiling of alterations in multiple genes [6]. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is released or excreted by tumour cells and circulates in the blood of a cancer patient; analysis of the fraction of mutant-alleles from ctDNA compared to normal-alleles from the patients’ normal genome provides opportunities for minimally-invasive cancer diagnosis and tumor monitoring [7]. Detection with ctDNA, which originates from all potential lesions, could overcome the disadvantages of single site biopsy given that the intra-tumoral and inter-lesional heterogeneity is common [6, 8]. Enrichment of plasma ctDNA and incorporation with the next generation deep sequencing techniques allow us to simultaneously detect the gene alterations of interest, e.g. EGFR/BRAF/HER2 mutations, ALK/ROS1/RET rearrangements, MET amplification, etc. in NSCLC, especially when it is difficult to obtain sufficient tissue samples.\\n\\nEGFR mutations and ALK rearrangement are generally considered to be mutually exclusive. However, some recent surveys and case reports showed co-existence of the two alterations within the same lesion [9, 10]. Here, we report an advanced NSCLC case with EGFR exon 19 deletion who experienced single-site progression in the liver after primary response to EGFR-TKI treatments and showed good response when adding crizotinib after the detection of ALK rearrangement signal through ctDNA. This special case highlights the feasibility and necessity of using ctDNA multiplex genomic profiling as an alternative approach in molecular diagnosis of NSCLC or in the exploration of the underlying mechanism in resistance to targeted therapies.

Thus, we firstly withdrew erlotinib and delivered methylprednisolone pulse therapy (500\\xa0mg qd * 5\\xa0days). However, no improvement was observed, which lead us to the diagnosis of lymphangitis carcinomatosa due to disease progression. Pemetrexed 0.8\\xa0g plus bevacizumab 300\\xa0mg (the tumor board decided to use a platinum-free regimen due to low tolerance to platinum of this patient, ECOG performance score 2–3), was then administered, but the lesions continued to grow rapidly.

In this case, the progressed liver metastases were large, bulky, and scattered. Radiotherapy or radiofrequency ablation was not an appropriate option. Metastatic hepatic lesions were supplied by portal vein system rather than hepatic artery system. Thus, transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) might not derive significant benefits. On the other hand, this case progressed dramatically after showing resistance to EGFR-TKIs. In this case, switching to chemotherapy is suggested according to what IMPRESS trial indicated [12]. Considering the previous evidence of the patients’ insensitivity to pemetrexed, we decided to use gemcitabine single agent chemotherapy. Meanwhile, we continued the use of HY-15772 API since all extra-hepatic lesions remained stable or even undetectable in the images, which suggested these lesions remained sensitive to HY-15772 API.'], hint: None\n",

In this case, as the entire left lobe of the liver was occupied by metastatic lesions that were loosened in structure, multidisciplinary consultation opinions suggested that conducting a fine-needle biopsy would be dangerous due to the high risk of bleeding. Recent advances in non-invasive rebiopsy approaches such as multiplex genomic profiling of ctDNA provided us an alternative [13]. We decided to obtain peripheral blood from this patient to perform a NSCLC-related multiplex genotyping, in order to clarify the resistance mechanism. Surprisingly, in addition to the 19del EGFR mutation that was previously discovered in the primary lesion, EML4-ALK fusion with relatively high abundance in plasma was detected. Given that the extra-hepatic lesions were all under control, indicating their lasting response to HY-15772 API, we added Crizotinib, the only approved agent to inhibit ALK-driving tumors, to the regimen without withdrawing the EGFR suppressor. Previous reports suggested no significant superimposed toxicity in dual treatment with EGFR and ALK inhibitors [14]. In this case, the patient presented rapid relief without any grade III adverse events. Undoutedly, the timely addition of ALK inhibitors salvaged the patient as previous gemcitabine showed no efficacy.\\n\\nThough some previous studies reported co-existence of EGFR and ALK in the same lesions, this is the first report showing ALK rearragement in distant metastatic lesions in a patient potentially harboring pure EGFR mutations in the primary lesion. Since rebiopsy for the liver metastases in the left lobe was not an option in this case, we had no direct evidence that the liver progression was driven by ALK fusion. However, the great abundance of EML4-ALK fusion signals in the plasma upon disease progression and the significant response after adding crizotinib (as well as the AP26113 API after resistance to crizotinib) strongly supported the existence of ALK fusion in the growing liver metastases. In addition, it was not likely that the primary lesion harbored concurrent EGFR mutation and ALK fusion because both routine ARMS and NGS re-analysis showed that no ALK fusion was detected and the pulmonary lesions were all in good control by HY-15772 API when the hepatic metastases progressed. Such heterogeneity might be more common than we have previously acknowledged, and might have a great impact on treatment strategy. In the past, we could only detect genetic alterations with site by site tissue samples. It was too difficult to obtain tissues from all lesions; multiplex genotyping with ctDNA might help address this issue. Thus, with the current technology, we should reevaluate the heterogeneity across different lesions and their incidence.

For example, renal- and pulmonary-limited types are considered mild forms of AAV (2, 3). In addition to these major target organs, other organs can occasionally be affected. For example, otitis media with AAV (OMAAV) is considered a part of limited organ-type vasculitis (4). Hepatic aneurysm is another a rare presentation of AAV (5-8), and retinal, breast, and urogenital structures can also become target organs on occasion (9).

Neck flexor/extensor muscles were well preserved, and the patient could easily lift his neck. Dysphagia was not observed.\\n\\nThe patient's level of consciousness was clear. No paralysis or sensory disorder was observed. In addition, cranial nerve impairment and dysarthria were not detected. Stocking and glove distribution of sensory loss were also not observed. However, the patient complained of limb pain but did not complain of numbness, a burning sensation, or pain in his hands and feet. We could not identify swelling of his joints, muscles, or superficial lymph node. Swelling of his left knee was not obvious at admission.\\n\\nNo eruption or erythema were observed, nor was Gottron's sign detected.

The white blood cell (WBC) count and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were elevated. A slight abnormality in the liver function test was also found. The creatinine kinase (CK) level was normal at admission, and no electrolyte disorder was identified. Urinary testing did not suggest the presence of glomerulonephritis. A cerebrospinal fluid examination was also normal. In addition, the thyroid function and adrenal gland function were within normal ranges (Table 1); however, chest X-ray showed a mild emphysematous change. Consistent with this, computed tomography (CT) showed emphysematous changes and a solitary hepatic cyst. No interstitial pneumonia was detected. Electrocardiogram (ECG) testing showed normal sinus rhythm. Cardiac ultrasound showed good wall motion without vegetation or pericardial effusion.

Traditional extrinsic compression with radial flow cessation leads to a local milieu likely associated with an increase in probability of radial artery occlusion (RAO). Our technique involves obtaining ipsilateral radial artery access distal to the neck of the RAP followed by a prolonged sheath dwell time covering the neck of the RAP which allows the RAP sac to thrombose and maintains radial artery lumen patency. © 2016 The Authors. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\nRAP is a rare complication of transradial access (TRA) and can occur as a sequela of arterial wall trauma and inadequate hemostasis after TRI. According Lemaitre J et al only 22 cases of RAP have been reported in world literature until 2006 1. In a recent publication only five cases of RAP were detected after 16,808 TRA (3 out of 10,000 catheterizations, 0,03%) 2, which is significantly lower compared to frequency of femoral pseudoaneurysm (0.6%) complicating femoral access 3. The prevalence of RAP may increase in the future due to growing popularity of TRI.\\n\\nTreatment of RAPs has evolved through the years. Initially surgical treatment was the dominant form of management for RAP. Subsequently, many cases have been treated with ultrasound‐guided mechanical compression. Recently, thrombin injection under ultrasound guidance has become the preferred treatment method.\\n\\nWe describe a novel technique for treatment of RAP using ipsilateral radial artery catheterization with long introducer sheath placement and gentle mechanical compression isolating the pseudoaneurysm with resultant cessation of flow in the sac, thrombosis and subsequent closure.\\n\\nCASE PRESENTATION\\nA 68‐year‐old man with previous posterior MI, persistent atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and moderately depressed left ventricular function (EF\\u2009=\\u20090,44) was admitted with life‐style limiting CCS class III angina. Diagnostic coronary angiography and possible PCI was planned using radial access. He underwent cardiac catheterization from the right radial using a 16 cm 6F hydrophilic introducer sheath (Terumo Interventional Systems, Japan). The radial artery had an anomalous origin from the mid‐segment of brachial artery. Coronary stenoses were identified in the right coronary artery (RCA) and PCI was planned as a second stage in 2–3 weeks. At the time of diagnostic examination patient was on warfarin therapy and additional clopidogrel was prescribed for the forthcoming PCI procedure. The International Normalized Ratio (INR) at the time of angiography was 1.09. The sheath was removed and hemostasis was achieved using TR band (Terumo Interventional Systems, Japan). Patient was discharged 6 hr after diagnostic procedure and a small hematoma was noted after removal of hemostatic device without any signs of bleeding.'], hint: None\n",

This swelling appeared 48 hr following discharge after lifting a heavy object with the right hand. A systolic bruit was audible over the mass and duplex ultrasonography demonstrated an oval‐shape dual chamber pseudoaneurysm measuring 49 X 38 mm, partially filled with thrombus. Pseudoaneurysm sac was connected to the radial artery lumen through a long (6 mm) and narrow (2 mm in diameter) neck (Fig. 2). Radial artery was patent and INR at the time of repeat hospitalization was 1.57.\\n\\nFigure 1 Pulsatile swelling at the right wrist just proximal to the previous puncture point of radial artery (arrow).\\n\\nFigure 2 Duplex ultrasonography demonstrated dual chamber (arrowheads) pseudoaneurysm of radial artery (RA) with turbulent blood flow and narrow neck connection (arrow) with RA lumen. Pseudoaneurysm sac was partially filled with thrombotic mass.\\n\\nAt this point we contemplated a combined strategy of PCI of RCA and repair of RAP.\\n\\nWe decided to use the affected radial artery as the access site for PCI, because ultrasonography indicated presence of sufficient length and diameter of intact artery distal to RAP for puncture and catheterization. After successful puncture of radial artery distal to RAP, a small vessel dilator (5F) was inserted into RA lumen and retrograde radial artery angiography was performed using low pressure manual contrast injection. Radial artery angiography confirmed RA patency and significant deviation of its anatomic course at the site of RAP was seen with the signs of RA lumen narrowing as a result of extrinsic RA compression (Fig. 3a). Pseudoaneurysm was visualized with turbulent blood flow into aneurysm sac with QCA measured dimensions of 38.7 X 36.8 mm. After advancing a 0.014” Prowater guidewire (Asahi Intecc, Japan), a 21cm 6F hydrophilic introducer sheath (Terumo Interventional Systems, Japan) was placed covering the neck of RAP therefore isolating the aneurysm sac from the blood circulation (Fig. 3b). PCI of RCA was performed through the 6F sheath (procedure duration 34 min) using a 6 French JR4 guide catheter, 0.014” Prowater guidewire (Asahi Intecc, Japan) and 3.5–15 mm Xience drug‐eluting stent. 70 Units/Kg of unfractionated heparin was administered intravenously at the beginning of the procedure. The sheath was left in RA lumen after completion of PCI for 8 hr.

Over time, arterial blood flow under high pressure creates a cavity outlined by inflammatory cells and fibroblasts subsequently replaced by fibrous tissue and the inner surface covered by endothelium.\\n\\nDevelopment of femoral artery pseudoaneurysm (FAP) is described well in literature with a reported incidence of 0.2% for diagnostic and 0.8% for interventional transfemoral procedures 4, 5. In contrast, the real world incidence of radial artery pseudoaneurysm (RAP) is unknown, probably because of lower incidence and underreporting.

      "Predicting with title: New technique for treatment of postcatheterization radial artery pseudoaneurysm., context: [\"Many small postcatheterization pseudoaneurysms tend to spontaneously thrombose over time 5. However, large pseudoaneurysms which do not thrombose spontaneously, should be treated, because potential complications of RAP may be nearby venous compression, thromboembolism and rupture with significant bleeding requiring urgent surgery 6, 7. Until recently, the standard technique of treatment has been surgical repair including radial artery ligation, patch angioplasty using vein segment, RAP ligation and excision with end‐to‐end anastomosis 8, 9, 10. During the past decade several minimally invasive methods have been introduced that have largely replaced surgical treatment. Most common techniques are ultrasound‐guided compression 2, 11, 12 and percutaneous thrombin injection into RAP sac under ultrasound guidance 2, 13, 14.\\n\\nUltrasonographically guided compression is associated with a high success rate 11, 12, but this technique also has significant limitations, including decreased success rate for patients taking long‐term anticoagulation therapy 11, 15 and prolonged compression time, often resulting in patient discomfort and pain. Sometimes there are recurrences after compression therapy subsequently requiring further compression attempts or surgery 16. Moreover, pseudoaneurysm with relatively rigid fibrous wall require prolonged forceful compression that may cause occlusion of small caliber radial arteries, despite use ultrasound guidance, as cessation of radial artery flow during compression has been identified a risk factor for subsequent radial artery occlusion (RAO) 17, as well as prolonged compression of the artery 18.\\n\\nUltrasound‐guided thrombin injection is a quick and more effective technique in almost all cases even in patients with anticoagulation therapy. However, direct thrombin injection into pseudoaneurysm sac is not without risk. The unattended escape of thrombin into adjacent main artery can result in thromboembolism to the distal arterial bed, resulting in necrosis 19. In recent publication Zegri et al described a case of asymptomatic RAO after thrombin injection in RAP sac2. Teh et al described a case of thrombin injection into temporal artery pseudoaneurysm with unexpected outcome of seizure and scalp necrosis 6. In another publication D'Achille et al presented a case where thrombin injection in RAP sac led to distal skin changes suggesting distal vessel embolization after possible thrombin entry in arterial circulation 20. Other reported complications included anaphylaxis 21 or generalized urticaria after bovine thrombin injection and pseudoaneurysm rupture 19.\"], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: New technique for treatment of postcatheterization radial artery pseudoaneurysm., context: ['Taking into account all issues mentioned above, we decided to use of lumen‐based flow interruption in the RAP sac using insertion of 6F arterial sheath into radial artery covering the RAP neck and protected the radial artery against external compression related consequences, such as RAO. The stasis of blood in RAP sac facilitates thrombosis of the sac and resolution of pseudoaneurysm, without the need of external compression. Moreover, if needed we can safely inject thrombin into RAP sac after covering RAP neck by the sheath without the risk of thrombin entry into the arterial circulation.\\n\\nInitial angiography demonstrated significant deviation and stenosis of RA at the site of RAP and solely mechanical compression even ultrasound guidance did not guarantee radial artery patency and sheath was protected arterial lumen against external mechanical compression. In general, arterial sheath acts as a temporary covered stent, which can be removed after successful closure of RAP. Permanent covered stents has been utilized with good results in treatment of pseudoaneurysms of large caliber arteries 22, but in radial artery with mean diameter less than 2.5 mm, use of permanent covered stents may be risky. For prevention of radial artery closure after long dwell time of the arterial sheath, patent hemostasis technique should be used after sheath removal to prevent RAO 23.\\n\\nPossible contributing cause of RAP formation in our case was inadequate index hemostasis with an adverse influence of long‐term systemic anticoagulation therapy, which likely facilitated persistent communication between main artery and pseudoaneurysm sac. Earlier, Collins et al. noted that full anticoagulation therapy, rather than inadequate compression, was a potential contributing factor for development of RAP 8. While radial artery access is favored in such high risk patients to avoid bleeding complications, ongoing anticoagulation therapy may predispose to RAP formation. Prolonged non‐occlusive hemostatic compression, as well as other measures such as, use of smaller diameter introducer sheath, temporary interruption of anticoagulation therapy and surveillance for RAP (palpation of radial puncture site, ultrasound examination) during follow‐up after TRI procedure, may lower the incidence and aid in early detection of RAP.\\n\\nDespite the success of temporary radial artery occluding technique with arterial sheath for nonsurgical RAP treatment some questions remain and require further investigation, such as optimal sheath/radial artery diameter ratio, appropriate sheath dwell time in the artery for reliable RAP closure and monitoring after successful RAP closure.\\n\\nCONCLUSION'], hint: None\n",

In the 1980s, Pneumocystis rRNA and mitochondrial DNA had been analyzed, by which this organism was identified as a fungus1). P. jirovecii belongs to the genus of Pneumocystis and is a human specific pathogen2). Serologic surveys show that most humans are infected by 2–3 years old3). In the immunocompetent children, these infections are usually asymptomatic. However, P. jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) usually occurs in severely immunocompromised hosts34). Prematurity, malnutrition in infants, immunosuppressive treatment, transplantation, primary immunodeficiency disorders and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are well-known risk factors for PCP5). PCP in immunocompromised persons can be a life threatening infection. It has been reported that up to 43% of children with cancer developed PCP before the era of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) prophylaxis and nowadays its occurrence is much less with prophylaxis3). However, certain immunocompromised patients still develop PCP56).

Among them 1 patient with severe aplastic anemia developed PCP twice at the age of 6 years and 16 years old.\\n\\nMedian age of the first PCP episode was 8.3 years (range, 0.4–18.6 years). Among these 14 patients, 10 patients (71.4%) had hematology-oncology diseases and two had primary immunodeficiency disorders (severe combined immunodeficiency and Wiskott Aldrich syndrome). One patient had systemic lupus erythematosus and the other received solid organ transplant. Four patients (26.7%) were transplant recipients; 1 allogeneic and 2 autologous hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients and one kidney transplantation recipient (Table 1). The main symptoms and radiology findings were shown in Table 2. Fever and dyspnea were the most common symptoms. Bilateral diffuse opacities were the most prominent radiologic finding (Table 2).\\n\\nIn 13 cases (13 of 15, 86.7%), patients were not receiving PCP prophylaxis within 1 month from the onset of PCP development. Median duration of last PCP prophylaxis to disease was 161.5 days (range, 1–493 days). Two patients developed PCP despite of prophylaxis. One patient with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) received PCP prophylaxis of pentamidine inhalation (TMP, 300 mg/dose) every month. The other patient with ALL received TMP/SMX prophylaxis (TMP, 120 mg/m2/day) on 2 consecutive days every week.\\n\\nFor treatment, TMP/SMX was given as a main therapeutic agent in all 15 episodes. Three patients were treated with pentamidine and TMP/SMX combination therapy and one patient was treated with caspofungin and TMP/SMX combination therapy.

The first patient died 41 days after the diagnosis of PCP despite aggressive antimicrobial treatment and ventilator care in an intensive care unit (ICU). He also had coinfection with Acinetobacter baumanii pneumonia. The second patient was diagnosed with PCP twice in 2004 and 2014, respectively. He did not receive any prophylaxis before both episodes of PCP. The patient was recovered from the first episode of PCP after TMP/SMX and pentamidine combination therapy with steroid. Ten years later, he developed the second episode of PCP and was treated with TMP/SMX and caspofungin combination therapy with steroid. However, during this 2nd episode, the patient also had probable invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) and died of progressing respiratory failure. The third patient developed PCP 104 days after the 2nd allogeneic HCT despite prophylaxis. Unfortunately, he also had bacteremia due to vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE). He was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for VRE bacteremia and also for PCP but died. The forth patient was an infant with neuroblastoma. The patient was not receiving PCP prophylaxis according to the protocol. She developed persistent tachypnea with low oxygen saturation for which PCP was suspected later and she received empiric treatment for PCP with TMP/SMX. She received TMP/SMX and pentamidine combination therapy with steroid. However, her condition became deteriorated and she died 28 days after PCP confirmation from the lung tissue. The last patient had a hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. He was developed a PCP despite of prophylaxis. He died of respiratory failure after 8 days of TMP/SMX monotherapy.\\n\\nDiscussion\\nThis study analyzed 15 episodes of PCP in 14 pediatric immunocompromised hosts that occurred in a single center where over 2,000 of pediatric immunocompromised patients have been cared during these 14 consecutive years. Although PCP cases are rare events nowadays due to prophylaxis strategy, there is still a handful of patients who may develop PCP due to various reasons. Our data showed that in over 86.7% of cases (13 of 15), patients were not receiving PCP prophylaxis within 1 months from the onset of PCP development.

Firstly, there were 2 patients with solid tumor who developed PCP during chemotherapy in which prophylaxis are not typically recommended. Secondly, there was 1 patient who developed PCP before the engraftment after HCT and did not have a chance to start PCP prophylaxis. Thirdly, there was one patient who developed PCP after the termination of recommended PCP prophylaxis period. Fourthly, in cases of primary immunodeficiency disorders, the 2 patients presented with PCP as one of the initial manifestations before being diagnosed with primary immunodeficiency disorders. Finally, there were patients who started PCP prophylaxis but stopped transiently with any reason, and did not resume prophylaxis properly even though the risk still existed.\\n\\nIt has been reported that non-HIV immunocompromised patients had more acute respiratory symptoms and needed more mechanical ventilator support than with those with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome7). Severe respiratory failure patients who needed the mechanical ventilator increased mortality rate up to 60% to 75%. Steroid is frequently used in PCP cases. However, unlike HIV patients in whom steroid use appeared beneficial8), there have been conflicting reports on steroid use in non-HIV patients with PCP9). Nine (9 of 15, 60%) of our patients also received steroid and all of the patients who needed ICU cared received steroid. Among the 9 patients treated with steroid, 3 patients (33.3%) died. In our study, due to the small number of PCP cases, we could not further investigate the effect of steroid in detail.\\n\\nThere are reports on efficacy of caspofungin for treating PCP cases10). In this study, 1 patient developed 2 episodes of PCP. For the first episode, he received TMP/SMX and pentamidine combination therapy with steroid and successfully recovered from the infection. For the second episode, he received TMP/SMX and caspofungin combination therapy with steroid but failed to recover from the infection and died of respiratory failure aggravation. It is not clear whether caspofungin was not efficacious in treating PCP in this patient because he also had IPA.

We report a case of lung cancer with CLC that caused both superior vena cava (SVC) stenosis and cervicofacial oedema, suggestive of SVC syndrome. A 64-year-old woman with lung adenocarcinoma presented with cervicofacial oedema and erythema, followed by severe dyspnoea 2 months after four cycles of carboplatin, pemetrexed and bevacizumab triplet therapy. Although chest CT indicated SVC stenosis, cervicofacial oedema remained despite treating the SVC stenosis via balloon dilation. A skin biopsy of the erythematic sample confirmed CLC as the cause of the patient's symptoms. CLC should be considered as a differential diagnosis of cervicofacial oedema in addition to SVC syndrome, especially when it is observed in combination with skin erythema and induration. Moreover, a skin biopsy should be performed promptly for accurate diagnosis of CLC and to decide on appropriate treatment.\\n\\nBackground\\nWhen lung cancer progression causes symptoms that reduce the ability to manage daily activities, adequate symptom treatment is required. Superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome is a major complication of lung cancer that occurs when the lung tumour compresses the SVC extrinsically, which causes cervicofacial oedema and dyspnoea.1 Among treatment options for SVC syndrome, an indwelling SVC stent effectively improves symptoms within a few days.1 Cutaneous lymphangitis carcinomatosa (CLC), a rare condition that accounts for less than 5% of cutaneous metastases, also causes cervicofacial oedema,2 and patients with CLC usually present with progressive lymphoedema and erythema.3 Here, we report a rare case of lung adenocarcinoma with CLC and SVC stenosis in a patient whose cervicofacial oedema and dyspnoea remained despite improving SVC blood flow via balloon dilation.\\n\\nCase presentation\\nA 64-year-old woman with a 20-pack-year smoking history presented with a persistent cough for 3 months.

This disease course is typical of SVC syndrome, which was the main cause of the symptoms. SVC syndrome arises from the compression of thin-walled SVC by enlarged paratracheal lymph nodes, mostly caused by lung cancer.1 The common symptoms of SVC syndrome include neck swelling, dyspnoea, facial swelling, cough and dilated chest collateral veins.1 Contrast-enhanced CT may elucidate the cause and extent of venous obstruction in SVC syndrome. The initial treatment in emergent cases of SVC syndrome is endovascular stenting of the SVC to restore flow. SVC stenting is reported to improve symptoms of SVC syndrome within 1–3 days, and recurrence rarely occurs.1 In the present case, SVC blood flow remained despite its prominent stenosis, and symptoms improved for only a few hours. The rapid recurrence of symptoms is atypical for SVC syndrome and indicates that there were other causes that made the patient’s symptoms more intractable.\\n\\nIn the present case, the patient presented with induration of the chest and abdomen, and a prompt skin biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of CLC. CLC is a rare form of skin metastases that exhibits extensive dermal and subcutaneous lymphatic invasion. This subcutaneous lymphatic invasion results in lymphoedema and diffuse skin erythema mimicking an infectious process, which differs from the typical form of cutaneous metastases such as nodules or masses.3–6 The incidences of cutaneous metastases in patients with metastatic cancer and with lung cancer are approximately 5% and 1.7%–3.1%, respectively; CLC accounts for approximately 5% of all cutaneous metastases.2 7 The most common histological feature observed in patients with lung cancer who develop CLC is adenocarcinoma, as in the present case.8 Cutaneous metastasis in lung cancer tends to occur in order in the anterior chest wall, back and abdomen.7 9–11 Cutaneous metastases are considered a late event in the evolution of the majority of malignancies.9 Lung cancer is the quickest to metastasise to the skin (15.75 months) among solid tumours.3 The average survival time from the appearance of CLC in lung cancer (less than 3 months) is shorter than that from the appearance of cutaneous metastasis (3 to 5 months).3 7 12 The only known treatment for CLC is systemic chemotherapy, but early diagnosis can lead to earlier anticancer treatment.8 Osimertinib may improve the prognosis of the patients harbouring the EGFR T790M mutation; however, osimertinib was not available for treatment at the time of this diagnosis.13–15 Supportive care for lymphoedema due to CLC, as follows, can improve patients’ quality of life and may even influence the progression of the disease: manual lymph drainage, compression therapy with bandages or special stockings, dermatological skin\\xa0care and psychological treatment.3'], hint: None\n",

Since then, only a few hundred cases have been reported. It was reported mostly in Asian patients as sporadic case reports and small case series [2]. Colorectal SRCC is very rare, comprising less than 1% of colorectal cancer (CRC) cases [3]. SRCC and mucinous adenocarcinoma (MAC) with signet cells are two overlapping entities. SRCC can occur within the pools of MAC or in a diffusely infiltrative process with minimal extracellular mucin in a linitis plastica [4]. On the other hand, the World Health Organization (WHO) defined MAC as a carcinoma confirmed by > 50% of extracellular mucin pools that contain malignant epithelial or individual tumor cells including SRCC [4]. SRCC mainly occurs on the right side of the colon [5]. The main differential diagnosis is metastatic gastric carcinoma with SRCC, and it is necessary to rule out this diagnosis by endoscopy before finalizing a diagnosis of primary colorectal SRCC. SRCC is associated with poor prognosis. Despite the rarity of SRCC, it is more frequently associated with patients with ulcerative colitis [6].

      "Predicting with title: A Rare Case of Signet Cell Carcinoma of Transverse Colon in a Young Patient With Ulcerative Colitis., context: ['CRC is the third most common cancer. In the USA, annually, approximately 145,600 new cases of large bowel cancer are diagnosed, of which 101,420 are colon and the remainder are rectal cancers [7]. Annually, approximately 50,630 Americans die of CRC, accounting for approximately 8% of all cancer deaths [6]. More than 90% of CRC cases are adenocarcinomas [8]; however, several histological variants have been distinguished such as mucinous, signet ring cell, medullary, adenosquamous, micropapillary, spindle cell and undifferentiated [8]. Signet cell carcinoma is a subtype of colon cancer. The name SRCC is a descriptive term describing a carcinoma cell retaining abundant intracytoplasmic mucin that causes the nucleus to be pushed to the periphery of the cell. In affected sites, the tumor infiltrates the entire wall, therefore results in a rigid and contracted structure called the linitis plastica [5]. The majority of these tumors arise in the stomach. However, it was also described in breast, lung, bladder, pancreas, gallbladder and the colon. It is a rare tumor comprising less than 1% of all CRC cases [2]. SRCC is predominant in males with a ratio of 2:1. Belli et al reported the most common location is the right side of the colon [9]. Our patient is a young man and had the tumor on the transverse colon. These tumors can be classified into either MAC with signet cell (a subtype of MAC) or SRCC. WHO definition of SRCC is carcinoma confirmed by > 50% of SRCC but states that SRCC can occur within the pools of MAC or in a diffusely infiltrative process with minimal extracellular mucin in a linitis plastica pattern [9]. Luis et al described in his retrospective study that 68.7% of SRCC cases occur in the right colon, 9.4% in the transverse and 21.9% in the left colon [5]. Our patient had the tumor on the transverse colon. Of the patients, 43.7% present with metastasis, whereas 64.3% of cases metastasize to the peritoneum, 46.5% present with lymph node metastasis (LNM) (mean of 14.3 positive lymph nodes), 62.5% with lymphovascular invasion and 25% with perineural invasion [5]. However, in the same study when SRCC was compared to MAC with signet cell, SRCC showed some distinctive characteristics. Patients presented a decade later (65 versus 56.5 years in comparison to MAC) as well as, in a higher clinical stage [5].\\n\\nThe pathogenesis of colorectal SRCC has not been fully understood yet. Tendon et al reported adenoma to carcinoma sequence for colorectal SRCC [10]. However, it is believed that SRCC may have a different mode of pathogenesis [11]. Hartman et al reported that precursor adenomatous lesions were more frequently observed in mucin-rich SRCC, and not in mucin-poor SRCCs [12]. There is an association between ulcerative colitis and SRCC. Colitis-associated carcinogenesis (CAC) leads to development of cancer through a different carcinogenic pathway known as the inflammation-metaplasia-dysplasia-carcinoma sequence with earlier identified molecular changes in TP531 [6].'], hint: None\n",

Together they represent about 30% of tumors with these genetic features [12]. The impact of MSI on survival in colorectal SRCC has not been confirmed to have a prognostic value on survival [12]. It is most likely due to small size of previous studies. Further research is required to confirm or reject this hypothesis [13]. In our patient DNA mismatch repair (MMR) protein analysis was performed. Analyses for MLH-1, MSH-2, MSH-6 and PMS2 were all normal. Mutations in the ras gene family (K-ras, H-ras and N-ras) are found in about 50% of CRCs. Ninety-five percent of ras mutations are identified at k-ras gene, with 80% at codon 12 and 15% at codon 13 [13]. There are limited data in the literature on ras gene mutations in colorectal SRCC.\\n\\nColitis-associated signet cell carcinoma in situ is associated with alterations of TP53 and CDH1 genes, resulting in a low expression of E-cadherin protein which impairs cell-cell adherence junctions and cell-proliferation signaling pathways.

Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody targeting CD 20 receptors on the membrane of B cells. In this case\\xa0report, we described a 79-year-old man who presented to our department with nausea, fatigue, and jaundice.

Antiviral therapy with entecavir and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate failed to improve his symptoms, and he died of fulminant hepatic failure. Rituximab targets CD 20 receptors positive B cells. It can destroy both cancerous and normal B cells. A decline in immune function can activate occult HBV infection. Prior to initiation of rituximab therapy, screening should be conducted in all cases for HBV associated serological markers. Patients with active or occult HBV infection must be started on appropriate antiviral therapy to prevent any severe outcomes with rituximab-containing regimens.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nIn 1997, rituximab was approved for medical use and to treat non-Hodgkins B cell lymphomas. It is listed as one of the most effective and safest medicines in the health system. It binds to CD 20 receptors on B cells, leading to the destruction of B cells including both the normal and cancerous cells [1]. It is especially used to treat diseases which have a high number of B cells or are characterized by abnormal B cells. By eliminating abnormal B cells, it allows the body to make normal and healthy B cells.\\xa0Normal B cells are rapidly depleted from the peripheral blood and remain depleted until nearly six months post-treatment, followed by a slow recovery [2].

After 11 months of complete remission (CR) following UCBT, the bone marrow showed 7.5% myeloblasts. CR was obtained after a single course of azacitidine monotherapy, but the myeloblasts gradually increased in the blood. We made a diagnosis of acute megakaryoblastic leukemia derived from donor cell with a fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of the sex chromosomes and an immunophenotypic analysis. Azacitidine was administered again and produced a therapeutic effect of stable disease. This case suggests that azacitidine may be a useful therapy for patients with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia in situations in which intensive chemotherapy and transplantation are not indicated.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nAcute megakaryoblastic leukemia has been described as a subtype of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) (1) and was incorporated into the French-American-British (FAB) classification of AML as M7 (2).

Histopathologic evidence of M7 AML itself is an independent poor prognostic factor for the overall survival (3).\\n\\nAzacitidine, a demethylation agent, has demonstrated a significant survival benefit in patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) relative to conventional care and has also been proved effective in older patients with newly diagnosed AML with >30% blasts (4,5).

After L-ASP monotherapy, we re-examined the surface markers of the leukemic cells by FCM, which showed positivity for CD41, as well as CD7, CD21, CD33, CD34, CD38, CD56 and HLA-DR (Fig. 3).

Table 3 shows the main characteristics of the original leukemia and donor cell leukemia in our report. HSCT is an effective treatment for many hematologic malignancies, but disease relapse remains a major cause of post-transplant mortality (6). DCL is de novo leukemia developing in donor-derived hematopoietic precursor cells and is a rare but severe complication after allogeneic HSCT. The incidence of DCL may have been underestimated because clinicians do not perform thorough examinations to distinguish between recipient-derived cells and donor-derived cells in cases of leukemia developing after HSCT. DCL has become well known, and a number of reports of DCL have been published in recent years (7-9). It is important to distinguish DCL from relapse of original diseases when patients develop leukemia mimicking the original diseases after allogeneic HSCT, especially in cases where a decision regarding treatment for the leukemia must be made.\\n\\nTable 3.

Shiozaki et al. reported that the characteristics of DCL occurring after UCBT were different from those occurring after bone marrow transplantation (BMT), including the duration of time between transplantation and the occurrence of DCL, and the types of abnormal karyotypes (11). DCL occurred within a significantly shorter period after UCBT than after BMT, with a median duration of 14.5 months for UCBT and 36 months for BMT. The frequency of monosomy 7 observed in DCL after UCBT was significantly higher than that in DCL after BMT. Greaves reported that up to 5% of CB samples might harbor potentially pre-leukemic clones, raising the possibility that DCL might be disproportionately common after UCBT (12).

In the present N\\xa0=\\xa01 case we retrospectively have analysed lymphoma tissue by exome sequencing and global gene expression in a patient with unexpected long-term remission following relaps. The goals were to phenotype the diagnostic and relapsed lymphoma tissue and evaluate its pattern. Furthermore, to identify mutations available for targeted therapy and expression of genes to predict specific drug effects by resistance gene signatures (REGS) for R-CHOP as described at http://www.hemaclass.org. We expected that such a study could generate therapeutic information and a frame for future individual evaluation of molecular resistance detected at clinical relapse.\\n\\n\\nMETHODS\\nThe patient was diagnosed with a transformed high-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma stage III and treated with conventional R-CHOP [rituximab (R), cyclophosphamide (C), doxorubicin (H), vincristine (O) and prednisone (P)]. Unfortunately, she suffered from severe toxicity but recovered during the following 6 months\\' remission until biopsy-verified relapse.

It can evolve into the more aggressive histology of transformed FL (tFL) [3], resembling diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), but share a distinct gene expression profile and immunophenotype with the primary FL [4–8]. This transformation occurs by the expansion of one or more subclones with loss of the follicular growth pattern resulting in a rapidly progressive clinical course refractory to treatment and with inferior prognosis. To distinguish between progression and transformation of FL a biopsy for histological examination is needed in case of symptoms and CT verified tumor progression. The histological verified presence of both follicular and diffuse architecture in the initial diagnostic biopsy represents a finding that implies early transformation of FL [2, 3]. The survival post-transformation ranges between median 7–20\\xa0months [9, 10].\\n\\nSimilar to progression, the transformation is a clonal evolution from an ancestral clone that initially arises from a common normal cell of origin (COO) through linear or branched outgrowth of an existing subclone, deregulated by random genetic or epigenetic hits.\\n\\nOur knowledge of genetic aberrations in FL has dramatically increased over the last few years, and recent comprehensive studies by exome sequencing has identified the mutational landscape and the genetic changes that contribute to the step wise tumor progression, including transformation to DLBCL [4–8, 11–18].\\n\\nHere we report a unique, biopsy and histology verified case of primary tFL with relapse and long-term remission following palliation therapy.

Pathologically enlarged lymph nodes were also detected in all supra- and infra-diaphragmatic stations and the spleen was enlarged (Additional file 1: Figure S1A, July, 2007). Furthermore, she had bilateral hydronephrosis.\\n\\nA tumor biopsy from an axillary lymph node was performed. Morphological examinations revealed a picture typical for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), but with nodular areas consistent with an underlying follicular lymphoma. The cells were monoclonal IgM+, kappa+, CD20+, CD19+, CD10+, CD38+, CD79A+, BCL2+ and BCL6+, CD30− with a high Ki67-estimated sproliferation rate. On the basis of these findings a diagnosis of DLBCL transformed from follicular lymphoma was made. The routine bone marrow biopsy and aspiration was clear for signs of lymphoma infiltration. The disease was categorized as stage III according to the Ann Arbor classification based on the extensive nodal involvement on both sides of the diaphragm.\\n\\nA combined modality treatment with six cycles of R-CHOP (Rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin (hydroxydaunomycin), vincristine (oncovin) and prednisolon) followed by consolidating radiotherapy against the abdominal bulk tumor was planned. Unfortunately, her treatment was complicated by severe infectious episodes including septicemia. After the final R-CHOP cycle, she had lost an additional 10\\xa0kg and was in a clinical poor performance status. An 18F-FDG positron emission tomography/CT (PET/CT) performed at this point showed a residual PET-negative tumor mass surrounding the aorta (Additional file 1: Figure S1B, January, 2008). As a result of her poor condition she entered post-therapy follow-up without receiving the planned radiotherapy.\\n\\nA routine PET/CT study performed after three months of follow-up confirmed continues remission (Additional file 1: Figure S1C, March, 2008). However, a routine PET/CT study performed 6 months into the follow-up period revealed clear progression of the retroperitoneal tumor in terms of increased size and FDG-uptake (SUVmax 11.2) (Additional file 1: Figure S1D, July, 2008).

Following parental informed consent, we performed genetic screening using next-generation sequencing in a targeted gene panel analysis for primary immunodeficiency disease and/or IBD including HPS1, HPS4, and HPS6 genes (Additional file 1) [1, 4]. We identified 2 heterozygous mutations in the HPS1 gene in the patient (c.398\\u2009+\\u20095G\\u2009>\\u2009A and c.1323dupA) and a heterozygous mutation in each parent (father, c.398\\u2009+\\u20095G\\u2009>\\u2009A; mother, 1323dupA).

In a study of 122 subjects with HPS, 8% overall were found to have IBD; among those with gastrointestinal symptoms, 33% were diagnosed with IBD [2].

Recent reports maintain that immunosuppressants and anti-tumor necrosis factor α therapy such as IFX may be effective for IBD in patients with HPS [2, 6, 7]. Use of compounds containing 5-aminosalicylic acid is an area of controversy because of the HPS platelet storage pool defect [1]. In fact, our patient is now in sustained clinical remission with colonic mucosal healing using only IFX.\\n\\nPatients with a diverse spectrum of rare genetic disorders can present with IBD, a situation referred to as monogenic IBD [4, 8, 9]. Patients with these disorders often develop symptoms during infancy or early childhood, along with endoscopic or histologic features of Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, or unclassified IBD. HPS is considered one of the monogenic IBDs [1, 2, 8]. Distinguishing monogenic forms among IBD patients under 6\\u2009years old can be crucial in determining the best treatment. Genetic screening using next-generation sequencing is a highly useful approach to diagnosis of patients with monogenic IBD [4, 8, 9]. In this patient, the clinical features of oculocutaneous albinism with nystagmus are consistent with an underlying diagnosis of HPS [1]. Such characteristic features may aid in diagnosing specific etiologies of infantile-onset IBD. Our patient represents a case in point; we diagnosed him with HPS-1 by genetic analysis as an infant and could treat him successfully with early introduction of IFX.\\n\\nIn conclusion, we consider our patient to be the first known HPS-1 patient with infantile-onset of IBD.

However, there is no consensus on the optimal treatment strategy, and the efficacies of these treatments for LM patients remain unsatisfactory.

There are several potential reasons for this phenomenon. Firstly, the survival of EGFR+ NSCLC patients has been significantly prolonged.6 Secondly, first (i.e. gefitinib) and second‐generation (afatinib) EGFR‐TKIs have poor penetration across the blood–brain barrier (BBB). The percentage of penetration ranges from 0.69% to 1.3%, which may provide a good opportunity for tumor cell growth in the CNS.7 Thirdly, as the treatment duration increases, the likelihood of the development of several secondary resistance mechanisms to EGFR‐TKIs also increases.8, 9, 10 Based on these considerations, the treatment options for EGFR+ NSCLC patients with LM generally include an intial high‐dose of first or second‐generation EGFR‐TKIs, or a switch to a different EGFR‐TKI.\\n\\n\\nEGFR mutations can be detected by analyzing circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in both plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which provides an alternative to tumor biopsies for further study.

As in this patient, the presenting complaint was diarrhoea, which was actually a manifestation rather than a cause for sepsis and clearly had a hidden diagnosis, which could have been missed if the patient was not adequately exposed.\\n\\nDiscussion\\nNecrotising fasciitis was first been described in soldiers during the American Civil war in the eighteenth century. This condition has been known by various names including phagadena gangrenosum, Meleney’s gangrene, Fournier’s gangrene (necrotising fasciitis of the perineum). The term necrotising fasciitis was first coined in 1952 by American Surgeon B Wilson.\\n\\nNecrotising fasciitis is classified into three types based on the organisms involved. Type I is polymicrobial, type II is monomicrobial and type III by a specific pathogen namely marine Vibrio species (V. vulnificus). Bacteria associated with type I are a combination of gram-positive cocci (streptococci and staphylococci), gram-negative species (Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas and Klebsiella) and anaerobic organisms like Bacteroides and Clostridia [1].\\n\\nNF is a rapidly progressing bacterial infection involving the subcutaneous tissues. The bacteria produce endotoxin and exotoxin [2] that leads to micro-vascular thrombosis [3], tissue ischaemia and liquefactive necrosis. This causes a systemic illness [4] often progressing to septic shock, multi-organ dysfunction and death. The condition is resistant to antimicrobial therapy due to poor drug penetration, hence leaving surgical debridement as the primary treatment option [5].'], hint: None\n",

Other factors include trauma, burns, insect bite, chronic skin ulcers and postoperative wound infection. Of these, type 2 diabetes is the commonest underlying medical condition and multiple needle punctures in IV drug users is the commonest trauma predisposing to NF [6].\\n\\nThe clinical picture and presentation of the patient may vary and hence can pose a diagnostic challenge at an early stage and hence requires a very high index of suspicion. The most common early signs are local erythema, warmth, induration, oedema and pain, which are also present in conditions like cellulitis and septic arthritis and hence the diagnostic dilemma. However, pain out of proportion to clinical signs associated with septic shock or failure to respond to broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics should alert the clinician to possible NF. Patches of skin necrosis, crepitus and bullae with compromised haemodynamic status are alarming signs.\\n\\nUltrasound, CT or MRI scan can be done in suspicious cases. Wong et al.

In previously described cases of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) associated with secondary ITP, treatment has consisted of nephrectomy, splenectomy, and corticosteroids. Here, we describe a case of metastatic RCC presenting with a right ventricular mass and subsequent development of secondary ITP. The clinical course was complicated by recurrent severe thrombocytopenia despite treatment with corticosteroids, rituximab, and thrombopoietin receptor agonists, precluding cancer-directed therapy and anticoagulation. Further study is needed to determine the optimal management strategy for malignancy-associated ITP.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nImmune thrombocytopenia (also referred to as immune thrombocytopenic purpura or ITP) is an autoimmune bleeding disorder characterized by isolated low platelet counts resulting from pathologic immune-mediated mechanisms. It occurs as a result of antibody-mediated targeting of platelet antigens in the setting of normal erythrocyte and leukocyte function without evidence of impaired bone marrow production. ITP is a common cause of thrombocytopenia in both children and adults, with an estimated incidence of 1.9–6.4 per 100,000 children/year and 1.6–3.9 per 100,000 adults/year [1]. Primary ITP is a diagnosis of exclusion, where no disorder or medication associated with thrombocytopenia is identified, whereas secondary ITP refers to thrombocytopenia attributable to an underlying disease or the development of drug-induced thrombocytopenia [2].\\n\\nAlthough secondary ITP is more commonly associated with rheumatologic disorders, infections, and hematologic malignancies, it is also seen in patients with solid tumor malignancies, with the highest reported cases in lung and breast cancers [3]. Approximately 20% of patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) experience some form of a paraneoplastic syndrome; however, secondary ITP associated with RCC is rare [4]. Removal of the primary tumor, corticosteroids, and splenectomy have been used to treat RCC-associated ITP with variable success [3]. Further, clinical data supporting effective therapies for patients with malignancy-associated ITP who are not surgical candidates is lacking. In this report, we describe a challenging case of secondary ITP in a patient with advanced RCC.\\n\\nCase Presentation\\nA 47-year-old female with a past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, depression, and tobacco use presented with chest pain and hemoptysis. Computed tomography (CT) angiogram revealed a large thrombus extending from the right ventricular (RV) cavity into the main pulmonary artery with additional bilateral segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli and evidence for right heart strain.

She subsequently underwent intracardiac tumor resection, pulmonary artery embolectomy, and tricuspid valve ring repair. Surgical pathology demonstrated unorganized to early organizing thrombus with prominent clusters of highly atypical cells with enlarged nuclei and atypical mitotic figures. Immunohistochemistry was positive for pancytokeratin, PAX-8, and CD10. Overall, the findings were consistent with a cytologically high-grade, pleomorphic tumor favoring metastatic RCC. Follow-up TTE revealed continued moderate RV systolic dysfunction though significant decrease in the size and mobility of the RV mass. Her postoperative course was complicated by anemia and volume overload. She was transitioned from unfractionated heparin infusion to warfarin and aspirin prior to discharge.\\n\\nAbdominal CT scan obtained as an outpatient revealed a 9.9-cm left renal mass, multiple associated enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes, moderate pericardial effusion, nodular and peripheral wedge-shaped opacities in the lung bases concerning for metastatic disease or pulmonary infarcts, and small right greater than left pleural effusions with pleural thickening concerning for malignant effusions.\\n\\nShe was re-admitted after a syncopal event, and chest CT revealed multiple bilateral pulmonary emboli and a 5.5 × 3.0 cm RV mass with severely reduced RV function. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed multiple cortical 2–3 mm foci of enhancement involving the bilateral frontal lobes concerning for metastases. Abdominal MRI was notable for retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy and increasing size (10.1 × 7.6 × 10.8 cm; Fig. 1) of the left renal mass without evidence of invasion of surrounding organs. Anticoagulation was continued on admission given concern that the pulmonary emboli in part were related to bland thrombus formation in addition to tumor emboli. Further cardiac surgery, vascular surgical intervention, or nephrectomy were determined to be unsafe. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) was considered for the brain metastases but was deferred during the admission due to the small size of the lesions.

Workup revealed negative heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)-PF4 antibody test, negative heparin-induced platelet aggregation assay, and normal ADAMTS13 activity. Peripheral blood smear revealed occasional schistocytes; however, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) was felt to be unlikely based on absence of clinical evidence for DIC and a normal fibrinogen level. Given concern for secondary ITP as a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with RCC, dexamethasone 40 mg daily was started for 4 days along with subcutaneous romiplostim (1 μg per kg weekly), a thrombopoietin mimetic used in treating ITP that stimulates bone marrow production of platelets by megakaryocytes [5].\\n\\nShe achieved a partial response with improvement in platelet count to 76 × 109/L after 4 days of dexamethasone and a single romiplostim treatment (Fig. 2). Severe thrombocytopenia recurred within 2 days of completion of dexamethasone. Prednisone 80 mg daily was started and the dose of romiplostim was increased to 3 μg/kg for the next dose (week 2 of treatment); and the platelet count stabilized at 55 × 109/L. The hospital course was complicated by development of a left upper extremity proximal deep vein thrombosis. Anticoagulation with low-dose enoxaparin 30 mg twice daily was initiated but was periodically held during the hospitalization for platelet counts less than 40 × 109/L. At discharge, enoxaparin was increased to 40 mg twice daily, romiplostim 4 μg/kg was administered, and prednisone was decreased to 60 mg daily. Outpatient plans were made to progressively increase romiplostim dosing and taper prednisone to maintain platelet counts high enough for anticoagulation without the need for steroids if possible, in order to receive systemic therapy for metastatic RCC.\\n\\nAt a 1-week follow-up appointment, the platelet count increased to 148 × 109/L. Enoxaparin was increased to 60 mg twice daily and prednisone dose taper was initiated. RCC-directed treatment was initiated with axitinib, a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, with plans to start pembrolizumab, a programmed death 1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, following SRS for brain metastases and completion of the prednisone taper. Ten days after starting axitinib, follow-up brain MRI prior to SRS demonstrated at least 15 new brain metastases. Whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) was planned instead of SRS, and axitinib was discontinued. Additionally, her platelet count decreased to 52 × 109/L with prednisone having been tapered to 10 mg daily while on weekly romiplostim (2 μg/kg).

While these initial therapies may produce a complete response (CR) as defined by platelet count ≥100 × 109/L and absence of bleeding [2], additional courses of corticosteroids for relapses are often necessary [6].

The development of a Bullous pemphigoid (BP)-like blistering disease, driven by autoantibodies against the hemidesmosomal protein BP180, is a potentially serious irAE whose incidence seems to be increasing. We therefore set out to characterize the clinical and (immuno)histopathological features and treatment responses of cases of BP which developed during or after CI therapy collated in six German tertiary referral centers between 2014 and 2018. We identified twelve cases of BP which emerged during and/or after CI therapy. The time interval between the initiation of CI therapy and the diagnosis of BP was 3-74 weeks (median: 23 weeks). Age at the time of diagnosis of BP varied between 62 and 80 years (median: 76 years). The clinical presentation of the patients was diverse but the severity was relatively mild when compared to that seen in most cases of spontaneous BP. Only four patients met all of the immunopathological criteria recommended in the European guidelines for the diagnosis of BP. Topical corticosteroid treatment was sufficient to achieve disease control in most patients. CI therapy could be continued in 8 out of 12 patients. In summary, our study indicates that cases of BP during or after CI therapy bear several peculiarities distinguishing them from spontaneous BP. Given the diversity of the clinical presentation of CI-induced BP the application of existing diagnostic algorithms developed for spontaneous BP can be utilized to uncover the frequency and features of CI-induced BP and to develop and optimize management algorithms.\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nCheckpoint inhibitors (CIs) constitute a new class of immunomodulatory drugs which block co-inhibitory signals on immune effector cells and result in the generation of potent T-cell mediated immune responses. Among the CIs which are currently licensed are monoclonal antibodies which target the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) or the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) pathway. For example, the first-in-class drug ipilimumab inhibits CTLA-4, nivolumab and pembrolizumab inhibit PD-1, and atezolizumab and durvalumab target the PD-1 ligand PD-L1 (1). The advent of checkpoint inhibitors has revolutionized the treatment of solid cancers. Initially licensed for the treatment of metastatic melanoma, CIs are employed in an ever increasing number of cancer entities, including Merkel cell carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, urothelial bladder cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and Hodgkin’s lymphoma (1).'], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: Retrospective Analysis of Checkpoint Inhibitor Therapy-Associated Cases of Bullous Pemphigoid From Six German Dermatology Centers., context: ['Given that the CTLA-4 and PD-1 pathways play a central role in regulating cellular immune responses, removal of this control mechanism can result in both generalized and tissue-specific inflammation. These inflammatory responses are collectively termed “immune-related adverse events” (irAEs), and include, but are not limited to, dermatitis, colitis, hypophysitis, hepatitis, and nephritis (1). The skin is the most frequently affected organ, with up to 50% of patients receiving CIs developing skin-related irAEs.\\n\\nThe clinical presentation of cutaneous irAEs is remarkably diverse. Commonly presenting with a non-specific maculopapular rash accompanied by pruritus, they may also present with lichenoid, eczematous, granulomatous, lupus-like, or erythema multiforme-like skin changes and/or vitiligo (2).\\n\\nMost intriguingly, there is a growing body of literature which reports the development of the antibody-driven autoimmune disease bullous pemphigoid (BP), the most common disease of the group of pemphigoid diseases, in the context of treatment with immune CI (2–8).\\n\\nThe hallmark of BP is the development of autoimmunity against type XVII collagen (BP180) (9). BP presents clinically with the development of widespread urticarial plaques (pre-bullous phase), which evolve into blisters and erosions (10, 11). However, non-bullous and atypical variants of BP also exist. In these variants, patients exhibit localized blister formation with minimal or absent inflammation of the surrounding skin. Additionally, BP may present with predominantly eczematous (including dyshidrosiform) and subacute prurigo-like skin changes (12). Indeed, BP may exist in the absence of skin changes, with the only symptom being widespread, intractable itch. Given the wide spectrum of clinical symptoms and signs in BP, the disease can neither be reliably diagnosed nor excluded based on the clinical presentation alone. The European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) guidelines recommend that the diagnosis of BP should be based on both the clinical findings and (immuno)pathological investigations of the patient’s skin, both lesional and perilesional, and serum (12). Central to establishing the diagnosis of BP is the demonstration of linear depositions of autoantibodies, which are in most cases predominantly of the IgG immunoglobulin class, and/or of complement factor 3 (C3) at the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ) of perilesional skin (12). As the deposition of autoantibodies and/or complement at the DEJ is the defining feature of all pemphigoid diseases and as the clinical features of BP may overlap with those of other pemphigoid diseases, the clear distinction of pemphigoid diseases requires the detection of autoantibodies in the serum and a determination of their antigen specificity. This is achieved by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy on NaCl-split human skin, which detects the presence of autoantibodies against proteins of the dermal-epidermal junction, and by ELISA biochip-based techniques, and/or immunoblot assays to pinpoint th'], hint: None\n",

Serological examination alone is not sufficient to diagnose BP given that autoantibodies are reportedly undetectable in the serum of up to 20% of BP patients, but are present in the serum of 0.5% of healthy individuals (12, 13). Histopathologically, an early blister exhibits a subepidermal cleft combined with a dense dermal inflammatory infiltrate mainly consisting of eosinophils and neutrophils. However, the histopathological examination is also non-specific and is therefore not suitable alone to confirm the diagnosis (14).\\n\\nThe complexity and heterogeneity of both BP and cutaneous irAEs means that a comprehensive clinical, serological, and (immuno)histopathological work-up is central to correctly diagnosing suspected cases of BP during or after CI therapy.

HCQ retinopathy can accompany other retinal complications such as cystoid macular edema (CME) and epiretinal membrane [1]. Specifically, CME is the result of fluid accumulation in the outer plexiform layer in the macular area and leads to central visual loss.\\n\\nSeveral treatment modalities have been shown to be effective for CME combined with other retinal diseases. In eyes with combined CME and retinitis pigmentosa, treatment with oral or topical acetazolamide can produce successful resolution of CME and functional improvement according to previous studies [2–7]. Although the pathogenic mechanism of CME in HCQ retinopathy has not been elucidated, oral or topical acetazolamide may also be useful in the treatment of CME in HCQ retinopathy. Here, we report a case of CME in HCQ retinopathy that improved with the use of oral acetazolamide. Using multimodal imaging modalities, we explored the detailed retinal structural changes, and discussed the possible mechanisms of CME in HCQ retinopathy.\\n\\nCase presentation'], hint: None\n",

The patient had first come to our clinic 7\\xa0months prior, at which time her best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/30 in both eyes and fundus examination showed bilteral midperipheral retinal degeneration. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) showed defects in the paracentral photoreceptor layers. Consistent with this finding, a visual field test revealed dense paracentral ring scotoma with decreased foveal sensitivity in both eyes (Fig. 1). The patient reported no family history of eye diseases and no visual symptoms before the initiation of HCQ therapy, and she had no auditory symptoms. At that time, the patient was diagnosed with HCQ-induced retinal toxicity, HCQ retinopathy, and HCQ treatment was discontinued. Four months later, BCVA was maintained as 20/30 in both eyes.Fig. 1 Diagnosis of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy based on visual field examination, optical coherence tomography, and fundus autofluorescence. a Humphrey 30-2 visual field test shows dense paracentral ring scotoma with decreased foveal sensitivity in both eyes. b Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) demonstrates defects in the paracentral photoreceptor layer. c Fundus autofluorescence reveals decreased paracentral and mid-peripheral fluorescence in both eyes\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDuring the patient’s visit of visual complaint, slit lamp examination showed no specific findings and there was no inflammation in the anterior chamber or vitreous cavity; however, her BCVA had declined to 20/50. SD-OCT examination showed the presence of a cystoid space within the inner retina and fluorescein angiography (FA) showed leakage in the macular area, a presentation typically associated with cystoid macular edema (CME), as well as diffuse leakage in the midperiphery (Figs. 2 and 3). Central macular thickness (CMT) was 245\\xa0μm and 335\\xa0μm in the right and left eyes, respectively.

CMT was decreased from 245 to 177\\xa0μm and from 335 to 146\\xa0μm in the right and left eyes, respectively. BCVA was improved to 20/25 in both eyes. Follow-up FA showed decreased dye leakage in both the macular and mid-peripheral areas (Fig. 3).\\n\\nDiscussion\\nHCQ retinopathy presents with initial photoreceptor damage in a classic parafoveal distribution, known as a “bull’s eye” pattern, which corresponds to parafoveal scotomas upon visual field examination [8, 9] and parafoveal thinning of the outer nuclear layer with breakup of the ellipsoid zone and interdigitation zone lines on SD-OCT. [10] However, recent studies have shown that the initial pattern of damage in Asian eyes is more frequently in the more peripheral extramacular area near the arcades, as a pericentral pattern [11, 12]. In this pattern of retinopathy, CME may threaten relatively preserved central vision, leading to deterioration of visual function.\\n\\nCME can develop in various retinal disorders [13]. Macular edema associated with chloroquine (CQ) retinopathy is relatively rare, and it was reported in 5 of 78 patients during a study period from 1957 to 1979 [14]; however, its treatment has not been discussed extensively. Although some cellular and molecular factors have been elucidated, the precise mechanisms for the formation of CME are unknown, including for HCQ retinopathy. In retinitis pigmentosa, CME formation has been suggested to involve breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier (BRB) as a result of chronic, low-grade inflammation [15–21] and decreased fluid transport efficiency of the retinal pigment epithelium [3]. CME associated with HCQ retinopathy has been reported in both leaking [22] and non-leaking [23] forms. In this case, it can be assumed that the leaking form of CME occurred owing to a mechanism such as BRB breakdown due to HCQ damage and that CME developed because such damage was not recovered even after the drug was cut off; however, the precise mechanism should be revealed in future studies.\\n\\nIn the present case, the CME associated with HCQ retinopathy exhibited diffuse leakage on FA that resolved with oral acetazolamide as evidenced by decreased fluorescein leakage. Acetazolamide reduces macular edema and improves visual acuity in some patients with macular edema related to certain inflammatory and degenerative eye diseases, including chronic iridocyclitis and retinitis pigmentosa [4]. With respect to mechanism, acetazolamide has been suggested to stimulate outward active transport and passive permeability across the BRB [6, 24, 25]. More specifically, acetazolamide blocks the active transport of certain ions (HCO3-, Cl-) across the retinal pigment epithelium [26], and also hastens the rate of resorption of subretinal fluid [27]. In our patient, acetazolamide was thought to induce functional recovery of the BRB, leading to a reduction in diffuse leakage and also improvement of CME.'], hint: None\n",

However, the patients in that study also had epiretinal membrane, which may have limited the beneficial effects of acetazolamide on reducing macular edema. Aside from carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, other treatment options for CME with HCQ retinopathy such as triamcinolone or anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibodies have not been described in the literature. In our case, there were no accompanying structural alterations to the central macular area such as epiretinal membrane, which likely explains why acetazolamide was effective for anatomic and functional improvement of CME.\\n\\nRetinitis pigmentosa associated with various types of mutations shows similar features to advanced HCQ retinopathy; therefore, retinitis pigmentosa should be carefully assessed for the differential diagnosis in patients taking HCQ medication. In the present case, the patient reported no family history of eye diseases and no visual symptoms before the initiation of HCQ therapy and she had no auditory symptoms. Genetic analyses on the associated mutations might be helpful for ruling out the possibilities of retinitis pigmentosa; however, we believe that the baseline (at the time of HCQ initiation) full-field electroretinography (ERG) and/or multifocal ERG may be very suggestive for the differential diagnosis.\\n\\nConclusion\\nIn conclusion, this case suggests that oral acetazolamide is an effective treatment for CME associated with HCQ retinopathy.

Severe ocular complications appear in less than 1% of the patients and require early treatment. We present the case of a patient diagnosed with a BRAF mutated metastatic melanoma. Ocular pain and a blurred vision appeared after treatment and the patient visited the ophthalmology emergency room, where he was diagnosed with acute anterior uveitis (AAU), synechiae, and bilateral papillitis. The patient was treated with topical corticosteroids, prednisone, and mydriatics, which immediately improved the patient's status. Therefore, when an ocular inflammatory disease exists, immune checkpoint inhibitor treatments must be ruled out as possible causes.\\n\\nPembrolizumab is a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody that is selective against the PD-1 receptor on the cell surface. It is used in the treatment of unresectable metastatic melanomas. The response rate of this treatment is about 40%.[1] Although the frequency of adverse effects is high, in majority of the cases these are mild and easily treated.[23] These side effects are known as immune-related adverse events because they are caused by the lack of inhibition of T lymphocytes.\\n\\nOcular complications appear in less than 1% of the patients and are severe and require early treatment.[1]\\n\\nCase Report\\nA 38-year-old male, Caucasian, diagnosed with a BRAF-mutant melanoma with locoregional recurrence, a satellite nodule, and adenopathies. Treatment with pembrolizumab was initiated. After 6 cycles of treatment, the patient began to experience ocular pain and blurred vision for which he visited the ophthalmology emergency room of the hospital, where he was diagnosed with AAU with synechiae and bilateral papillitis. He had a visual acuity (VA) of 20/20, Tyndall +++ in the right eye (OD) and Tyndall++++ in the left eye (OS) with multiple inferior iridocrystalline synechiae in both eyes (OU) and no hypopyon. Edema of the bilateral papilla without vitritis was observed in the fundoscopy [Fig. 1]. Treatment with dexamethasone eye drops and 40 mg of prednisone every 24 hours was initiated in the emergency room. Cyclopentolate, tropicamide, and phenylephrine eye drops were also prescribed to break the synechiae. The examination after 24 hours revealed Tyndall++ in OD and Tyndall + in OS and no synechiae were found. There was an improvement of the bilateral papillitis. The oncologist in charge of the patient and an ophthalmologist expert in uveitis considered the pembrolizumab to be the primary cause of ocular inflammation since the mechanism of action of the drug can induce ocular inflammation and there are similar cases reported in the literature.

To avoid activating the immune system, T cells have receptors that inhibit activation. Two of these receptors are CTLA-4 and PD-1. The metastatic cells of the melanoma are capable of expressing ligands for these receptors and hence, inhibit the activation of the immune system. Ipilimumab was the first of this family of drugs known as an immune checkpoint inhibitor, which acts by inhibiting the ligands of the CTLA-4 tumor cells and therefore T cells proliferate, invade the tumor cells, and help in the process of regression. Pembrolizumab acts in the same way but on PD-1 ligands.[6]\\n\\nThe mechanism that explains the development of ocular inflammation during the use of pembrolizumab is as follows: The presence of PD-1 ligand in ocular cells has been demonstrated and it is believed that the expression of these PD-1 ligands mediates in the ocular inflammation by inhibiting the proinflammatory cytokines produced by T cells. Thus, it is believed that the presence of PD-1 inhibitors can contribute to the development of ocular inflammation.[1]'], hint: None\n",

However, in this case glucose plasma levels were between 151 and 184\\u2009mg/dL for initial four days that may show a role in the ultimate degree of toxicity.\\n\\nAnother finding in this case was the development of mild respiratory and metabolic alkalosis. However, metabolic acidosis has been reported in most of the reported cases [5–16]. Metabolic acidosis could be resulting from systemic hypotension and acute kidney injury.\\n\\nARDS manifests with diffuse alveolar inflammation and increased pulmonary vascular permeability resulting in hypoxemia [23].

There was disease progression despite therapy with mycophenolate and intravenous immunoglobulin. Serial intravitreal injections of triamcinolone resulted in restoration of photoreceptor anatomy on optical coherence tomography and visual improvement.

Approximately 50\\u2009% of patients with CAR present with visual symptoms before the diagnosis of a malignancy is made [3]. CAR is rare, and there are currently no standard treatment regimens for the condition [4]. Systemic corticosteroids, steroid-sparing immunosuppression, and non-traditional immunomodulatory therapies including intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) have been shown to variably preserve or improve vision [5–7]. Cystoid macular edema (CME) has been reported in patients with non-paraneoplastic autoimmune retinopathy (npAIR) but is less common with CAR [2]. We report a patient with CAR in whom serial intravitreal steroid injections resulted in maintenance of visual function for more than 2\\xa0years until his death.\\n\\nCase report\\n\\nA 67-year-old man presented with decreased vision, photopsias, and nyctalopia. Examination revealed best corrected visual acuities of 20/32 in the right eye and 20/25 in the left eye. Dilated fundus exam was remarkable for bilateral CME and arteriolar narrowing (Fig.\\xa01a). Fluorescein angiography (FA) revealed petalloid leakage at the fovea, perivascular leakage, and disk staining bilaterally (Fig.\\xa01b). Multifocal and full-field electroretinography (ERG) revealed severely decreased scotopic and photopic responses but no negative ERG pattern. Serologic testing revealed the presence of antibodies to a 46-kDa retinal protein that was confirmed to be alpha enolase. Systemic evaluation for malignancy uncovered poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Chemotherapy was initiated with carboplatin and paclitaxel.

      "Predicting with title: Intravitreal triamcinolone for cancer-associated retinopathy refractory to systemic therapy., context: ['This report describes the successful treatment of CAR with intravitreal steroids. The treatment of CAR is often challenging. Treatment of the underlying malignancy alone does not alter the course of the ocular disease. Various treatment modalities have been tried in patients with CAR, including oral and intravenous steroids, plasmapheresis, IVIg, rituximab, azathioprine, cyclosporine, and mycophenolate mofetil [2, 6–8]. Despite treatment with these systemic medications, it is not unusual to have a progressive decline in vision with this disease. Our patient responded initially to systemic steroids but did not have an alteration of his disease course with mycophenolate mofetil or IVIg. After initiation of IVTA injections, his vision improved. Vision improvement in CAR is unusual; vision stabilization is often the best that can be hoped for. In this patient, there was strong evidence for a causal relationship between the injections and visual improvement. When the intravitreal triamcinolone wore off, his vision declined. With his initial injections, the improvement in vision could be attributed, at least in part, to treatment of the CME. But subsequent injections were given when there were no retinal cystic changes or thickening present on OCT and yet reinjection led to marked subjective and objective improvement. The improvement was likely due to suppression of inflammation around the photoreceptors as evidenced by restoration of inner segment/outer segment junction and resolution of hyperreflective lesions along the photoreceptor layer on OCT after the injections. In one such instance, his vision recovered from hand motions to 20/32 OS.'], hint: None\n",

There is one case report of retinal periphlebitis associated with CAR in a patient with ovarian cancer [9]. In the presence of CME, intravitreal steroids have previously been shown to be effective in patients with npAIR [2]. The unique presentation of CAR with CME and vasculitis in our patient motivated the use of intraocular triamcinolone, but there was evidence for an effect on the course of CAR directly given the visual improvements even when IVTA injected in the absence of CME. The presence of anti-retinal antibodies in the sera of patients with CAR suggests the need for systemic intervention in general, but this patient’s course suggests that a subset of CAR patients might be successfully treated with local therapy. The OCT photoreceptor findings in this patient pre- and post-injection indicate that intravitreal steroids may be able to successfully suppress inflammation and apoptosis induced by the autoantibodies at the level of the photoreceptors despite ongoing systemic production and/or circulation of antibodies. Some authors caution that readministration of intravitreal steroid for recurrent CME in npAIR and CAR is best done early when cystic changes are just starting to recur to avoid cycles of retinal cyst expansion and collapse which may cause retinal damage [2, 10]. Similarly, CAR patients without CME being treated with intravitreal steroids should be followed closely with OCT imaging and retreated promptly when evidence of photoreceptor layer disruption becomes apparent to avoid permanent photoreceptor damage.\\n\\nIn summary, intravitreal steroids should be considered in patients with CAR who do not respond to systemic therapy.

Patients with severe mental illness have a higher risk of developing the condition compared to the general population. Methods: We observed 10 cases of VTE in patients with mental illness who were treated with the antipsychotic drug olanzapine. The diagnosis of VTE was made at the University Hospital Hradec Kralove (UH HK) from 2004 to 2013. VTE was objectively determined by imaging techniques (duplex ultrasonography, CT angiography) and laboratory tests (D-dimer). The average age was 46 years. The clinical manifestation of VTE was deep vein thrombosis in nine cases, including one case of simultaneous pulmonary embolism and one case of a concurrent ischemic cerebrovascular accident (iCVA). None of our patients had a history of malignant disease, trauma, or surgery. Results: Apart from antipsychotic medication, all the patients had clinical or laboratory risk factors for VTE. The most frequent clinical risk factors were obesity (n = 7) and smoking (n = 6). The most frequent laboratory risk factors were increased levels of FVIII (n = 4), mild hyperhomocysteinemia (n = 3), and factor V Leiden mutation (n = 2). VTE developed within 3 months after antipsychotic drug initiation in three patients and within 6 months in three patients. Conclusion: Olanzapine can be considered a precipitating factor for VTE formation. When olanzapine is administered, we need to monitor for clinical signs and symptoms of VTE, especially when other risk factors are present.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nVenous thromboembolism (VTE) is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition. Manifestations of VTE include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). VTE is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Considerable amounts of money are also spent on the treatment of VTE in the developed countries of Europe and North America. VTE affects approximately 1.0–1.8 people per 1,000 annually (1, 2). The incidence rises exponentially with age, and the risk significantly increases in people over the age of 40 years (3). Multiple risk factors are involved in the development of VTE. VTE risk factors can be divided into physiological and pathophysiological, clinical and laboratory, and congenital and acquired factors (\\nTable 1\\n) (1, 2, 4).\\n\\nTable 1 Risk factors for VTE [adapted from Refs.

The risk of thrombosis rises significantly when multiple factors occur together. In older patients, acquired risk factors occur more frequently, which explains the significantly increased incidence of VTE in the elderly population.\\n\\nThe pathophysiological mechanism underlying VTE formation is the development of a relative thrombophilic state. This involves a shift in the hemostatic system towards thrombosis. If a genetic disposition is prominent in the etiopathogenesis of VTE, patients are determined to have hereditary thrombophilia. If external risk factors prevail, the condition is determined to be an acquired hypercoagulable state. A hypercoagulable state may result from the presence of any of the conditions belonging to the so-called Virchow triad (venous stasis, hypercoagulability, and vessel wall damage) (1, 2).\\n\\nIn patients with a mental illness, the risk of VTE is increased for several reasons. In a previous study, we found significantly increased activation of markers of thrombogenesis (sP-selectin, D-dimer, FVIII) in untreated patients experiencing a first episode of psychosis compared to healthy volunteers (5). The markers of thrombogenesis continued to be elevated after 1 year of treatment (6). Antiphospholipid antibodies (APAs), especially anticardiolipin antibodies (ACLAs), may serve as a marker of autoimmune reactivity, or they may directly interfere with phospholipid metabolism in schizophrenia patients. They may also have prothrombogenic effects. Inflammatory markers are also elevated during acute psychosis, which may lead to an increased risk of pathological blood coagulation (7). Hyperhomocysteinemia, which is also a risk factor for VTE, can occur in patients with mental disorders who also smoke, have poor dietary habits, and consume excessive amounts of coffee\\n\\nAntipsychotic medications are another risk factor for VTE in patients with a psychotic disease (8). Antipsychotic drugs contribute to the development of a hypercoagulable state through several potential mechanisms, including drug-induced sedation, obesity, hyperprolactinemia, increased platelet aggregation, and elevation of APA (5, 9).'], hint: None\n",

The highest risk of VTE emerges during the first 3 months after initiation of antipsychotic treatment (12). Other studies found the highest risk in the first month after the initiation of an antipsychotic (13, 14). In addition to the time period following drug administration and the antipsychotic drug class used, other risk factors include using higher drug doses, using a combination of several antipsychotic drugs, and parenteral administration of antipsychotic agents (15).\\n\\nThrough a long-term project named ANTRE (ANTipsychotics, ThRombosis, Embolism) involving interdisciplinary cooperation within the University Hospital in Hradec Kralove, we have been aiming to develop a comprehensive approach to the issue of VTE in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Cases of VTE development are carefully recorded. In addition to isolated case reports of VTE development during treatment with different antipsychotic agents, we recorded 10 cases involving the administration of olanzapine.\\n\\nPatients and Methods\\nThe patient group consisted of a total of 10 patients (women n = 3) who were treated with olanzapine. VTE occurrence was monitored prospectively between 2004 and 2013 in a specialized outpatient unit for VTE treatment. The average age of the patients was 46 years, with a range of 17 to 71 years. Three patients had a diagnosis of delusional disorder, two had paranoid schizophrenia, and two had bipolar disorder. The other patient diagnoses were an addiction to multiple narcotic drugs, behavioral disorder related to pregnancy and puerperium, and mental retardation with a behavioral disorder. The duration of psychiatric illness prior to the occurrence of VTE was determined. We also determined the duration and dose of olanzapine utilized prior to VTE and recorded other psychotropic drugs taken concomitantly. Information was collected from patient-reported history, the hospital information system, and reports by attending outpatient psychiatrists. None of the patients had previously suffered from VTE. Patient history was used to determine if there was a family history (FH) of VTE. In the patient group, VTE occurred either during hospitalization or during outpatient care. VTE diagnosis and subsequent treatment were conducted by an internist. If clinical symptoms suggested VTE, then additional examinations were conducted.

It is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. In clinical practice, the spectrum of its use is much wider. Off-label indications include psychotic disorders of various etiologies (toxic and organic), behavioral disorders in patients with dementia, eating disorders, and personality disorders. The relatively high incidence of olanzapine-related VTE may be distorted by the high number of patients treated with this antipsychotic agent.\\n\\nA possible prothrombogenic mechanism of olanzapine at the molecular level is an affinity for 5-HT2A serotonin receptors. Blocking these receptors results in increased platelet aggregation and increased blood coagulability (16). Blockade of α1 adrenergic receptors by olanzapine may cause hypotension and thereby venous stasis in the lower limbs. Another mechanism may be olanzapine-induced production of the antiphospholipid antibodies: lupus anticoagulant (LA) and ACLAs (17). Increasing these APA titers is associated with a prothrombogenic state (18). Olanzapine may also induce a temporary increase in prolactin levels early in the course of treatment. Hyperprolactinemia correlates with increased levels of P-selectin, a platelet activation marker (19).\\n\\nMetabolic symptoms caused by olanzapine represent an indirect mechanism for VTE development. The prothrombogenic metabolic symptoms that often occur during olanzapine treatment include hyperglycemia, hyperleptinemia, dyslipidemia, and weight gain (20). Weight gain is mainly due to the blockade of H1 histamine and 5-HT2C serotonin receptors by olanzapine.\\n\\nObesity [body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30)] is associated with an up to two-fold increase in the risk of VTE development. Obese patients have reduced fibrinolytic activity and capacity. Higher levels of the procoagulation factors FVIII and FIX also occur (21).

They mostly cause nosocomial infections associated with surgical procedures. This case study is the first report of a Raoultella infection in Africa. Case presentation We report a case of a surgical site infection (SSI) caused by Raoultella planticola which developed after caesarean section (CS) and surgery for secondary small bowel obstruction. The patient became febrile with neutrophilia (19,157/µL) 4\\xa0days after laparotomy and started to develop clinical signs of a SSI on the 8th day after laparotomy. The patient continued to be febrile and became critically ill despite empirical treatment with ceftriaxone and vancomycin. Raoultella species with extended antimicrobial resistance (AMR) carrying the CTX-M-9 β-lactamase was isolated from the wound discharge. Considering the antimicrobial susceptibility test, ceftriaxone was replaced by ceftazidime. The patient recovered and could be discharged on day 29 after CS.\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nRaoultella planticola was isolated from an infected surgical site after repeated abdominal surgery. Due to the infection the patient's stay in the hospital was prolonged for a total of 4\\xa0weeks. It is noted that patients undergoing surgical and prolonged inpatient treatment are at risk for infections caused by Raoultella. The development of a SSI caused by Raoultella planticola with extended AMR has to be assumed to be a consequence of ineffective antibiotic utilization. The presented case advices that rare bacteria as Raoultella should be considered as potential cause of nosocomial SSI with challenging treatment due to high levels of AMR.\\n\\nBackground\\nRaoultella are Gram-negative rod-shaped aerobic bacteria growing in water and soil. They can also be detected in the human gastrointestinal tract (GIT) or upper respiratory tract (URT) and are a rare cause of mostly nosocomial infections in humans. They were defined as a new genus in the family of Enterobacteriaceae in 2001, based on gene sequences of its 16S rRNA and rpoB gene [1].

The chemotherapy was administered through a Poweport® device, the position of which was confirmed with fluoroscopy and function confirmed by flushing the line. Urgent intervention was required as patient was symptomatic and experienced severe right-sided pleuritic chest pain. Radiology also confirmed the extravasation of doxorubicin into the pleural space.

Use of dexrazoxane should always be considered following intra-pleural extravasation because of its potential efficacy and reasonable tolerability. However, the best approach to extravasation injury is prevention by systematic implementation of careful, standardized, evidence-based administration techniques.\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\nAnthracycline extravasation is a feared complication of intravenous (i.v.) chemotherapy due to the tissue toxicity of this group of drugs. The reported incidence of the chemotherapy extravasation in the literature varies from 0.01% to 6% [1, 2]. However extravasation into thorax is rare, so far only 10 cases have been reported [1, 3]. A retrospective single centre study showed that improvement in staff training reduced the incidence of this complication by a factor of 10 (0.1–0.001%) over 15 years.\\n\\nVesicant injuries can progress within hours or days, resulting in lasting tissue injury and necrosis. Management is considered an emergency requiring combination of medical and surgical care.\\n\\nManagement of dermal extravasation is well established often requiring reconstructive surgical repair and use of DMSO which is a topical agent [2]. The effects of these agents into pleural or lung tissue are not well defined and there are no standard approaches in the management of accidental intra-pleural extravasation.\\n\\nOur case report describes a 54-year-old female who presented with intra-pleural extravasation of doxorubicin from a malpositioned central venous catheter. Management consisted of urgent surgical intervention and dexrazoxane, which proved to be effective in the long run.\\n\\nCASE REPORT\\nA 54-year-old woman (Mrs XY) was transferred from another facility for management of iatrogenic infusion of doxorubicin into the pleural space through a migrated central venous catheter.\\n\\nHer only medical history was stage IIIA left breast cancer oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive.

Prior to the first cycle of chemotherapy, long-term central venous access was established using a Poweport® device. This was inserted through the right subclavian vein using Seldinger technique and no complications were noted at time of procedure. The line position was confirmed with fluoroscopy and function confirmed by flushing the line (see Fig. 1).\\nFigure 1: Position of the line confirmed with fluoroscopy and function confirmed by flushing the line\\n\\n\\n\\nRoutine chest X-ray following procedure demonstrated correct catheter position with no complications.\\n\\nThe first cycle of chemotherapy consisting of 85 mg of i.v. doxorubicin (60 mg/m2) in 50 ml of normal saline and 850 mg of cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2) was given 5 days post-insertion of the port. Prior to the administration of the cytotoxic agents, it was noted that there was no withdrawal of blood from the port on aspiration. Doxorubicin infusion was commenced by nurses as they were able to infuse a flush solution without resistance. Following 6 ml (10 mg) of infused doxorubicin, Mrs XY complained of severe right-sided pleuritic chest pain. Fluoroscopy contrast study demonstrated that central venous catheter had curled unusually, causing perforation of superior vena cava or the azygos vein and migrated into the pleural space (see Fig. 2).\\nFigure 2: Fluoroscopy contrast study showing contrast medium flowed over the surface of the lung in the pleural cavity. The Port-A-Cath tubing tip is now in the pleural cavity.\\n\\n\\n\\nMrs XY was transferred to our institution for urgent surgical washout of the pleural space and i.v. dexrazoxane. She received i.v. dexrazoxane within 6 hours of extravasation. A dose of 1000 mg/m2 was used, administered immediately before the operation followed by 500 mg/m2 daily for 2 days post-operatively.\\n\\nA right thoracoscopic-assisted pleural lavage was performed the same day. The tip of the central catheter was visually identified lodged in the pleural space but there was no frank pneumonitis or direct parenchymal injury to the lung. The catheter was not broken and sutures were found to be intact.

Compared with other types of injectable anti-tumour drugs, anthracyclines have the potential to cause the most damage or complications because of their mechanism of action on tissue when they extravasate. Anthracyclines bind to the nucleic acids in the DNA of healthy tissues when they leak out of a vein. This process causes cell death and continues to do so as more drug is released into the surrounding tissue. These injuries can become larger, deeper and more painful as the cycle repeats itself [2].\\n\\nCentral venous catheters are frequently used for infusion of vesicant drugs as they provide reliable venous access, high-flow rates and rapid drug dilution. Unfortunately, they may also involve complications, including drug extravasation.\\n\\nImplementation of proper guidelines regarding use of venous catheters for chemotherapy can minimize or prevent complications. Location of the catheter tip should be in high-flow vessels to prevent cytostatic accumulation, which may lead to catheter thrombosis and vessel wall perforation [1]. Prior to anthracycline administration, it is critical to ensure port or peripheral catheter patency and position radiographically. Furthermore, it is necessary to reconfirm the positioning of the catheter when it is not possible to draw blood or infuse a flush solution prior to start of the chemotherapy infusion [4]. In this case, by means of brief aspiration of blood before giving anthracycline, followed by flushing of sodium chloride or glucose solution may have resulted in the detection of the catheter displacement.\\n\\nIndications of extravasation include symptoms of pain or fever. Lab investigations most frequently reveal leucocytosis. Radiology, most preferably CT scan, should be used for diagnosis of extravasation [1, 3, 4].'], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: Management of anthracycline extravasation into the pleural space., context: ['Immediate discontinuation of the infusion and aspiration of as much solution as possible through the central venous catheter must be done in all cases of extravasation [3]. Identification of local extravasation and surgical intervention wherever feasible to remove as much of the agent as possible [3] and at the same time administering dexrazoxane must be instituted to prevent major complications [4].\\n\\nBefore the approval of dexrazoxane for anthracycline extravasation, topical DMSO, ice application and/or use of steroids were recommended as a plausible approach. In the review of intrathoracic extravasation of chemotherapeutic agents from implanted ports by Bozkurt et al., anthracycline extravasation was reported in two cases and one case was in combination with five fluorouracil. Most of the patients developed pleural effusion like our Mrs. XY or pericardial effusion. Management consisted of aspiration of the residual drug as much as possible before removing the catheter, flushing of the cavities with normal saline and/or systemic administration of steroids. Surprisingly, all of them had a favourable outcome [3].\\n\\nIn 2007, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved dexrazoxane for injection for the treatment of extravasation resulting from i.v. anthracycline chemotherapy [5]. Dexrazoxane acts as a reversible topoisomerase II inhibitor and ring chelating agent, thereby reducing the formation of anthracycline–iron complexes, which are toxic to surrounding tissue [2, 4].\\n\\nIn Europe, two prospective clinical studies of the efficacy of dexrazoxane (TT01 and TT02) in preventing the potentially devastating effects of biopsy-proven anthracycline extravasation in the skin demonstrated that dexrazoxane treatment is highly effective both on a short and long-term basis. Epirubicin was involved in 56% of the cases, 41% were treated with doxorubicin while two received daunorubicin. Four out of 57 had extravasation involving central venous access device and none of them required surgical intervention. The 3 day treatment schedule with dexrazoxane consisting of a daily dose of 1000 mg/m2 on days 1–2 and 500 mg/m2 on day 3 proved effective in preventing surgery-requiring necrosis. Haematological toxicities and transient elevation of liver enzymes associated with dexrazoxane were manageable [2, 6].\\n\\nSince FDA approval of dexrazoxane, subsequent clinical case reports have supported the above-mentioned study findings, and the systemic antidotal treatment has shown value in anthracycline extravasation. Promising results were obtained from a 2007 to 2010 Belgian survey involving 41 patients treated with dexrazoxane from 29 centres. It showed that surgical debridement due to anthracycline extravasation could be avoided in 95.1% of cases (39/41 extravasations) with use of dexrazoxane with manageable toxicities reported in only 8/41 cases [2].'], hint: None\n",

[4] regarding the evolution and management of intra-pleural extravasation through a CVAD using dexrazoxane resulting in a favourable long-term outcome with similar strategy.\\n\\nIn conclusion, prevention is the best approach for managing chemotherapy extravasation. Prior to using venous catheters, their position and function should be adequately checked, with adherence to surgical and oncological procedures. Anthracyclines should be administered as a short infusion only in the presence of healthcare professionals with oncology training.\\n\\nA prospective clinical trial involving the use of dexrazoxane in intra-pleural extravasation is unlikely.

Introduction\\nCrimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is an arthropod-borne viral infection that infects domestic and wild animals and can be transmitted to humans via several routes. The causative agent of CCHF is an RNA virus of the genus Nairovirus belonging to the Bunyaviridae family of viruses (1). Over several decades, serious outbreaks with high case-fatality rates have been reported from different parts of the world, including the Middle East (2-6). CCHF is becoming a global problem, and more cases are expected to be diagnosed as the disease becomes endemic to more areas due to movement of livestock, changes in hunting activities and agricultural practices (7). A real threat exists to health care workers managing patients with CCHF and causing nosocomial outbreaks, which may have high fatality rates (8). Another concern is related to the potential use of the virus as a weapon of bioterrorism, given the limited availability of diagnostic laboratory services with Biosafety Level 4 facilities (9).\\n\\nCCHF is not endemic to UAE; however, two documented limited outbreaks occurred in 1979 and 1994 and were associated with high mortality rates among infected health care workers (10, 11).

Epidermal necrolysis spectrum eruptions such as Stevens–Johnson Syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are considered a continuum and share the same pathogenesis. They are only differentiated on the body surface area by epidermal detachment [2]. Epidermal detachment of\\u2009<\\u200910%, 10–30% and\\u2009>\\u200930% are designated as SJS, SJS/TEN and TEN, respectively [2, 3]. The mortality rate ranges from 1 to 5% for SJS, and 25 to 35% for TEN [2].\\n\\nSJS and TEN are rare severe cutaneous reactions with annual incidences of 1.2–6 and 0.4–1.2 per million people, respectively [4, 5]. The common cause of SJS/TEN is drug exposure, while infections, contrast media, and vaccinations are mainly linked to SJS. Drugs commonly associated with the development of SJS/TEN include cotrimoxazole, nevirapine, allopurinol, sulfasalazine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, lamotrigine, and carbamazepine [1]. The estimated incidence of cutaneous adverse drug reactions (CADRs) to psychotropic medications among psychiatric inpatients is 2–5% [6]. Lange-Asschenfeldt et al. observed that antiepileptic drug (AED) mood stabilizers accounted for the highest CADR rate as a drug group, followed by antidepressants, while antipsychotics were the least commonly involved medications in CADRs [6]. Psychotropics with a high risk of epidermal necrolysis are carbamazepine, lamotrigine and phenobarbital [3]. Recent studies have also reported on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)-induced epidermal necrolysis, and have implicated fluoxetine, paroxetine, fluvoxamine and mirtazapine [7–11].

      "Predicting with title: An Interesting Case of Carbamazepine-Induced Stevens-Johnson Syndrome., context: ['Carbamazepine is a well-known causative agent of drug-induced SJS among psychotropics [3]. Rare cases of SSRI-induced epidermal necrolysis, i.e. SJS and TEN, have been described in the literature [7–11]. To our knowledge, no cases of epidermal necrolysis have been described with coadministration of carbamazepine and an SSRI. In the case presented, the patient had been taking carbamazepine for 14\\xa0days after discontinuing fluoxetine. The temporal relationship between the development of SJS after the addition of carbamazepine suggests that carbamazepine was the causative agent. Although the median latency period (interquartile range) for the development of SJS with carbamazepine is 15\\xa0days (12–20) [12], latency periods of 4\\xa0weeks have also been reported [13]. The latency period for SSRI-induced SJS is 1–3\\xa0weeks. Using the Algorithm of Drug causality for Epidermal Necrolysis (ALDEN) scoring system for SJS/TEN, carbamazepine scored +6 and fluoxetine scored +2. Therefore, carbamazepine and fluoxetine were considered ‘very probable’ and ‘possible’ causes of SJS, respectively, in our patient [14].\\n\\nCarbamazepine-induced SJS has long been thought of as an idiosyncratic, dose independent, unpredictable adverse event specific to an individual [15]; however, current evidence indicates that carbamazepine-induced SJS/TEN is a predictable, specific, delayed hypersensitivity immune reaction involving human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles specific for carbamazepine and other drugs in defined populations [16]. HLA-B*15:02 and HLA-B*31:01 have been associated with carbamazepine-induced SJS in Asian (Han Chinese, Thai, Indian and Malaysian) and Caucasian (and Japanese) populations, respectively [17–19]. Recent evidence suggests this possibility, as shown by the phenytoin and nevirapine-induced SJS/TEN associated with reduced drug clearance due to metaboliser enzyme polymorphisms [20, 21]. However, we were not able to genotype our patient for HLA alleles, therefore we cannot confirm the involvement of the phenotype-specific characteristics of the patient that might have contributed to the development of SJS. Although association with specific HLA genotypes may be necessary, it is not sufficient for the development of SJS/TEN [18]. Other factors such as the individual variation in drug metabolism or clearance, HIV-1 seropositivity, polypharmacy, and competitive drug inhibition may also play an important role in SJS/TEN development with carbamazepine [1, 18, 22, 23].'], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: An Interesting Case of Carbamazepine-Induced Stevens-Johnson Syndrome., context: ['It has been postulated that no biologic effect is dose-independent [24] and that immune-mediated reactions only occur when a critical dose threshold has been reached [15, 25]. The maximum incidence for idiosyncratic reactions is often at a dose below the therapeutic range and remains constant within the therapeutic range [24]; however, this biologic dose-dependency principle (and possibly immune tolerance) is used successfully in desensitisation protocols for the safe introduction of medicines known to have idiosyncratic reactions [15, 24, 25]. Given the current understanding of idiosyncratic reactions, a potential increase in carbamazepine plasma concentration due to CYP3A4 inhibition by fluoxetine and norfluoxetine may have reached the threshold for the immune-mediated carbamazepine-induced SJS in our patient, leading to the observed adverse reaction [25, 26]. Increases in plasma carbamazepine or its metabolites increases the likelihood of adverse events, and possibly SJS, as occurs with phenytoin [27, 28]. It is possible that prior administration with fluoxetine may have increased the risk for SJS in our patient. The inhibitory capacity on CYP3A4 substrate clearance can persist up to 3\\xa0weeks post administration of fluoxetine due to the long half-life of norfluoxetine [29]. In our patient, carbamazepine was administered 14\\xa0days after fluoxetine was discontinued; however, we were unable to measure plasma concentrations of carbamazepine to confirm that competitive inhibition of metabolic enzymes by fluoxetine or norfluoxetine was involved in the development of SJS in our patient. Therefore, we cannot conclude that prior administration of fluoxetine may have increased the risk of carbamazepine-induced SJS.\\n\\nAlthough epidermal necrolysis is rare with the use of SSRIs, several case reports have been documented for SJS or TEN with mirtazapine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine and paroxetine [6–10]. Many of the reported cases have occurred in female patients who had received an SSRI for a duration ranging from 3 to 14\\xa0days. In our case, the patient had discontinued fluoxetine for 14\\xa0days when she developed SJS. However, fluoxetine and its major metabolite norfluoxetine have long elimination half-lives of 1–4 days and 7–15\\xa0days, respectively [30].

However, the occurrence of serious adverse events may cause a decline in QOL. We investigated the relationship between outpatient chemotherapy-induced adverse events and QOL.\\n\\n\\nMETHODS\\nA single-center retrospective descriptive study was conducted in patients who received outpatient chemotherapy at Gifu University Hospital (Gifu, Japan) between September 2017 and December 2018. The utility values of QOL, type and severity of adverse events, type of cancer, chemotherapy regimen, and other patient demographics were analyzed.

Moreover, cancer chemotherapy has transitioned from inpatient to outpatient settings because of advancements in supportive care measures against cancer and changes in the healthcare environment to reduce medical costs [1–4]. Hence, patients are able to continue their personal life and work by undergoing chemotherapy in an outpatient setting. In fact, Ishiura et al.

Furthermore, Mark et al.

The Japanese version of the EQ-5D-5L was developed by Shiroiwa et al. [14] to evaluate QOL reflecting Japanese values. The EQ-5D-5L is widely used in clinical studies and health status surveys targeting the general population and uses a comprehensive scale based on preferences to assess cardinal changes in health status [15, 16]. While the values in the Japanese version [14] differ from those in the original, the utility values of QOL in this study were calculated using the Japanese version of the EQ-5D-5L to reflect the values of the Japanese people. We used a hybrid model prepared by mapping discrete choice experiment (DCE) data onto composite time trade-off (cTTO) data [14] to determine the EQ-5D-5L utility value.\\n\\nWe applied to the EuroQoL Group for use of the Japanese version of the questionnaire and obtained permission before use. The Japanese version of the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire was used in face-to-face interviews to estimate the utility values of QOL [14] and was routinely implemented by pharmacists during each patient visit. The utility values were recorded in the hospital’s electronic medical records.\\n\\nThe five dimensions assessed by the EQ-5D-5L are mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each of these is assessed according to five levels of severity: level 1, no problem; level 2, slight problem; level 3, moderate problem; level 4, severe problem; and level 5, unable or extreme problem [13]. A utility value ranging from 0 to 1 was calculated from the EQ-5D-5L, which was defined as the primary outcome of this study. According to the Japanese version of the utility value conversion table, “0” indicates death and “1” indicates full health [17]. The EQ-5D-5L contains only five questions, and patients receiving outpatient chemotherapy can easily answer these questions at each cycle. For these reasons, we used the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire in the present study.\\n\\nAssessment of adverse events\\nAll patients were provided with a daily checklist to confirm their side effects on their first visit to the outpatient chemotherapy clinic.

Therefore, we investigated the changes in QOL induced by anticancer drugs in patients with peripheral neuropathy. These changes were examined at three time points: prior to peripheral sensory neuropathy (control), during the development of peripheral sensory neuropathy (pre-intervention), and after pharmaceutical intervention for peripheral sensory neuropathy (post-intervention).\\n\\nSpecifically, to show that utility values for QOL were reduced by the appearance of peripheral neuropathy, we compared utility values for QOL between “control” and “pre-intervention” time points. In addition, to show that the effect of pharmaceutical intervention for peripheral neuropathy increased utility values for QOL, we compared utility values for QOL between “pre-intervention” and “post-intervention” time points.\\n\\nStatistical analysis\\nPatient demographics were summarized using medians with the 25th and 75th percentiles for parametric variables. Frequencies and percentages are shown for non-parametric variables. As the distribution of the EQ-5D-5L utility value was heavily skewed, we employed proportional odds logistic regression to assess the effect of adverse events on QOL after adjusting for covariates.

This model performs well for skewed continuous outcome variables using the ranks of data. In addition to the moving difference between the current and previous grade of adverse events (changing grade), age and sex were included in the multivariable model. Adjusted associations were analyzed using a regression model with the Huber-White robust sandwich estimator, with patients as a clustering variable. In the secondary analysis, we confirmed the effect of cancer type and anticancer drugs on the EQ-5D-5L utility value using a proportional odds logistic model with adjustment for covariates. An adjusted odds ratio < 1 indicates that QOL is more likely to be worse on average in patients with adverse events, cancer, or those taking anticancer drugs.

Organ systems that rely most on aerobic metabolism, such as the brain, heart and the skeletal muscle, are more inclined to be influenced by mitochondrial dysfunction.

The term of isolated mitochondrial myopathy refers to the condition where mitochondrial disorders primarily affect the skeletal muscle system.

After expectant treatment of oxygen inhalation, he recovered to a relative stable condition and drove home. He developed increasing shortness of breath in the following days, which eventually deteriorated into acute respiratory failure. Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis showed a pH of 7.25, and a PaCO2 of 86.25 mmHg. Although the PaO2 level was in a normal range by treatment of oxygen inhalation, the diagnosis of type II respiratory failure was considered because of hypercapnia. A pulmonary function test suggested a moderate restrictive ventilator impairment. No evidence of pneumonia or bronchitis was found through Computed Tomography (CT) scanning.

Here, we present the unique case with metastatic GISTs who derived clinical benefit from apatinib following the failure of imatinib and sunitinib. Case presentation: A 57-year-old man was admitted to our hospital diagnosed with metastatic and recurrent GISTs following surgical resection. Fifty-four months after the first-line imatinib treatment, he developed progressive disease and then was treated with cytoreductive surgery combined with imatinib. Disease progression occurred after 7 months. He then received second-line sunitinib and achieved a progression-free survival of 11 months. Apatinib mesylate was then administered. Follow-up imaging revealed a stable disease. Progression-free survival following apatinib therapy was at least 8 months. The only toxicities were hypertension and proteinuria, which were both controllable and well-tolerated. Conclusions: Treatment with apatinib provides an additional option for the treatment of patients with GISTs refractory to imatinib and sunitinib.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nGastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal neoplasms of the gastrointestinal tract (1). Most GISTs harbor activating mutations in either gene encoding KIT or platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α (PDGFRA) (2, 3), which are type III receptor tyrosine kinases (4). After the identification of activating mutations, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are used for GISTs (5), which also significantly improved prognosis of patients with metastatic or recurrent disease (6). Imatinib mesylate is recommended as initial therapy based on drug activity and drug tolerability according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline for advanced GISTs (7). For patients with metastatic or unresectable GISTs after the failure of imatinib, sunitinib is considered (7). However, resistance to sunitinib eventually develops in most patients, after a median of 6–9 months (8). Although regorafenib can significantly improve survival as the third-line treatment, median progression-free survival (PFS) was only 4.8 months. Therefore, the development of efficacious and safe therapies is required for the treatment of metastatic or unresectable GISTs after the failure of imatinib and sunitinib.'], hint: None\n",

Similarly, apatinib is a potent VEGFR inhibitor apart from the KIT inhibitor. The role of VEGF in GISTs, however, has not been established. Imamura et al. suggested that angiogenesis associated with VEGF might play an important role in in the progression of GISTs (22). Several ex vivo studies of GIST specimens have demonstrated that microvessel density is associated with VEGF expression and closely related to the prognosis of the disease (23, 24). Recently, Verboom et al. proposed that SNPs in the genes encoding for VEGFR2 was associated with PFS in patients with advanced GISTs treated with imatinib (25). Consolino et al. suggested that VEGFR2 and VEGFR3 expression may be related to progression of imatinib-resistant GISTs, and the direct targeting of the receptors may have the potential to decrease tumor growth by the inhibition of angiogenesis (26). Thus, apatinib may have clinical benefits for patients with GISTs refractory to imatinib and sunitinib and need to be further tested in large-scale clinical trials.\\n\\nConclusion\\nThe present case demonstrates that apatinib provides an additional option in the treatment of patients with GISTs refractory to imatinib and sunitinib.

Currently, most research focuses on vaccine development or pharmacological treatment strategies for hospitalised patients with COVID-19.1 However, to reduce global morbidity and mortality, effective treatment strategies for non-hospitalised patients are required.\\n\\nFamotidine may be a candidate medication for this. Famotidine is a histamine-2 receptor antagonist, widely available over the counter at low cost, does not interact with other medications and has been safely used for suppression of gastric acid production over a wide range of oral doses from 20\\u2009mg once daily to 160\\u2009mg four times daily.2 In computer simulations, famotidine was identified as a potential inhibitor of the 3-chymotrypsin-like protease,3 and this and other potential mechanisms of action for famotidine in COVID-19 are an area of current research. In a propensity score matched retrospective cohort study a significantly reduced risk for death or intubation (adjusted HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.88) was identified for patients with COVID-19 who were incidentally taking famotidine before or at the point of hospital admission.4\\n\\n\\nThe incentive for the retrospective cohort study were the unexpected positive results from a group of 10 patients who took famotidine following onset of symptoms for COVID-19.

Information on patient demographics, comorbidities, COVID-19 test results, famotidine use, drug-related side effects, temperature measurements, oxygen saturations and symptom scores were obtained. We collected longitudinal severity scores on five symptoms (cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, headaches and anosmia), based on an NIH endorsed Protocol to research Patient Experience of COVID-19, in addition to general unwellness.5 Symptom scores were retrospectively provided by patients on an ordinal scale: 1=not affected, 2=little affected, 3=affected and 4=severely affected. This four-point scale was based on performance status scoring in patients with cancer who are systemically affected by illness or treatment. We adapted the first four scale points of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) scale6 and provided explanatory text to the patients as part of the symptom questionnaire. We chose only those scale points of the ECOG PS as measures of grades of severity that are relevant to a severity of COVID-19 illness that does not require hospitalisation.

We report a case of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-negative pauci-immune glomerulonephritis with massive intestinal bleeding and cerebral hemorrhage.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nPauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis (GN) is one of the most common causes of rapidly progressive GN (RPGN). Most patients with pauci-immune crescentic GN have glomerular disease as part of an antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)–associated systemic vasculitis, such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, or as a part of renal-limited vasculitis [1]. Because ~75–90% of patients with pauci-immune crescentic GN have circulating ANCA, ANCA is known as a major serologic marker to distinguish pauci-immune crescentic GN from other types of RPGN [2]. Although there is little information about ANCA-negative pauci-immune crescentic GN owing to a relatively small number of patients, several studies have reported fewer systemic vasculitis manifestations in ANCA-negative crescentic GN than ANCA-positive cases. Hemorrhagic complications in pauci-immune crescentic GN are common, but massive gastrointestinal bleeding or cerebral hemorrhage in ANCA-negative pauci-immune crescentic GN has rarely been reported. Herein, we report a rare case of recurrent massive intestinal bleeding that was caused by an uncontrolled vasculitis combined with ANCA-negative pauci-immune crescentic GN.\\n\\nCase report'], hint: None\n",

Pitting edema greater than Grade III of the lower limbs was noted. Lung auscultation was normal, and no purpura was found on the skin. Initial laboratory test results showed white blood cell count 8,300/mm3; hemoglobin 10.7\\xa0g/L; platelets 277,000/mm3; blood urea nitrogen 54.5\\xa0mg/dL; serum creatinine 3.5\\xa0mg/dL; total protein 5.9\\xa0g/dL; albumin 3.0\\xa0g/dL; total calcium 8.4\\xa0g/dL; phosphorus 5.0\\xa0mg/dL; prothrombin time (international normalized ratio) 1.08; and activated partial thromboplastin time 34 seconds. Urinalysis revealed many red blood cells (RBCs) per high-power field, and protein (4+) and occult blood (2+) were also detected. The spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio was 3.5\\xa0g/g.\\n\\nHer renal function deteriorated rapidly over 7 days (serum creatinine concentration increased from 3.5\\xa0mg/dL to 7.0\\xa0mg/dL) and exhibited features of RPGN. Therefore, we performed a renal biopsy and other serologic tests. The serum immunoglobulin levels, including immunoglobulin (Ig)G, IgM, and IgA, and complements, including C3 and C4, were within normal ranges. Immune serologic result was negative for antinuclear antibody and antiglomerular basement membrane antibody. ANCAs also showed negative in indirect immunofluorescence and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.\\n\\nThe renal biopsy specimen showed cellular or fibrocellular crescentic formation in 92% (57/62) of glomeruli (Fig. 1).

Initial resuscitation was conducted using a crystalloid solution and packed RBC transfusion. Although emergency gastroscopy and colonoscopy were performed, the bleeding focus was not detected, but a large amount of old blood was observed in the terminal ileum. After 2 days, a colonoscopy was performed again, but abnormal findings associated with bleeding were not detected. Then, a capsule endoscopy was attempted to determine if the bleeding focus was located in the small bowel. However, owing to a slow small bowel transit time, the entire small bowel could not be observed because the capsule did not reach the mid-to-distal ileum. On the 22nd hospital day, recurrent massive hematochezia occurred. Abdominal computed tomography angiography showed active arterial bleeding on the ileal loop, and selective superior mesenteric arteriography revealed an active contrast extravasation in a branch of the distal ileal artery (Fig. 3). We selectively performed embolization with a permanent embolic agent (n-butyl cyanoacrylate; 0.5\\xa0mL tissue adhesive, 1.5\\xa0mL ethionidized oil mixture), and the bleeding stopped.\\n\\nDespite successful embolization, massive hematochezia occurred again after 2 days. Her hemoglobin level was 6.5\\xa0g/dL, and platelet count was 40,000/mm3. The patient received two units of packed RBCs and five units of platelet concentrate. Emergency colonoscopy showed multiple segmental ulcerations on the terminal ileum, which was consistent with ischemic damage due to embolization of the distal ileal artery (Fig. 4). The patient underwent hemodialysis because of intractable metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, and fluid overload. Anemia associated with schistocytes and transfusion-refractory consumptive thrombocytopenia was also present, consistent with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA).

      "Predicting with title: Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-negative pauci-immune glomerulonephritis with massive intestinal bleeding., context: ['Pauci-immune crescentic GN is part of systemic small-vessel vasculitis and usually associated with the presence of ANCAs directed against myeloperoxidase or proteinase 3. Although the pathogenesis of ANCA in vasculitis is not fully understood, ANCA is known to activate neutrophils by different mechanisms, such as direct Fab02 binding to ANCA antigens on leukocyte surfaces or Fc receptor engagement by ANCA immune complexes, leading to apoptosis and necrosis of neutrophil and endothelial cells [3]. However, in ANCA-negative small-vessel vasculitis, neutrophil infiltration of the pathologic lesion is reportedly related with other unidentified autoantibodies or T-cell–dependent mechanisms [4].\\n\\nDespite limited information about ANCA-negative pauci-immune crescentic GN, ANCA-negative patients reportedly show severe renal manifestations, such as nephrotic-range proteinuria, poorer renal outcomes, and less extrarenal involvement such as fever, arthralgia, skin rash, abdominal pain, or mononeuritis multiplex, compared with ANCA-positive patients [5–7]. Similarly, our case also showed nephrotic-range proteinuria of 3.5\\xa0g/d and diffuse cellular crescentic formations in >90% of glomeruli on renal biopsy. Initially, extrarenal manifestations were not observed.\\n\\nOur patient had no evidence of asthma, eosinophilia, or granuloma of the upper respiratory tract. Based on the 2012 International Chapel Hill Consensus criteria, we were able to diagnose MPA and exclude granulomatosis with polyangiitis and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis from the possible systemic small-vessel vasculitis conditions. Hemorrhagic complications in patients with pauci-immune crescentic GN are common [8]. Small-vessel vasculitis can cause local or diffuse pathologic changes in the gastrointestinal tract, including ulcers, bowel wall edema, hemorrhage, paralytic ileus, ischemia, obstruction, and perforation [9–12]. Although necrotizing GN and pulmonary capillaritis are very common in MPA, several cases with gastrointestinal bleeding have been reported. Interestingly, a Japanese case diagnosed with MPA and pauci-immune crescentic GN showed active bleeding of the superior pancreaticoduodenal artery and iliac branch of the superior mesenteric artery [13]. The characteristics of this case were very similar to those of the present case: old age, absence of circulating ANCA, massive active bleeding, and absence of small artery involvement on kidney biopsy. However, our case showed a poor clinical course and a feature of MAHA. Thrombotic microangiopathy is characterized by platelet aggregation in systemic circulation, thrombocytopenia, and mechanical hemolysis. Although coexistence of thrombotic microangiopathy and pauci-immune crescentic GN is rare, pauci-immune crescentic GN could trigger thrombotic microangiopathy through endothelial damage by proinflammatory mediators [14]. Secondary ischemic multiple ulcerations after embolization, thrombocytopenia caused by consumption of platelets due to recurrent bleeding, and MAHA contribute to poor'], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-negative pauci-immune glomerulonephritis with massive intestinal bleeding., context: ['outcomes.\\n\\nInitiation of conventional treatment for pauci-immune crescentic GN with or without ANCA consists of intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy followed by progressive reduction of oral prednisolone (initially 1\\xa0mg/kg/24\\xa0h) and cyclophosphamide, either intravenously at a dose of 0.5–1\\xa0g/m2 or orally at a dose of 2–3\\xa0mg/kg/24\\xa0h [15]. Our patient received conventional treatment according to this schedule, but massive hematochezia occurred 15 days later. In life- or organ-threatening conditions, such as lung hemorrhage or severe ANCA-related renal vasculitis, plasma exchange may be recommended. In cases with gastrointestinal bleeding, widely accepted treatment methods are lacking. Therefore, our patient only received embolization without plasmapheresis or other immunosuppressants, based on previous reports. The causes of intracerebral bleeding in our patient were not clear. Although there was a high possibility of the hemorrhagic complications of systemic vasculitis, brain magnetic resonance angiography was not performed. Various factors that could increase bleeding tendency, such as a uremic condition, low platelet count, or frequent transfusions, may contribute to intracerebral bleeding.\\n\\nIn summary, to the best of our knowledge, there are only a few reports regarding ANCA-negative pauci-immune crescentic GN with massive gastrointestinal bleeding. Therefore, the present case is interesting and informative, reporting recurrent massive intestinal bleeding and fatal intracerebral bleeding as a serious hemorrhagic complication of ANCA-negative pauci-immune GN.\\n\\nConflicts of interest\\nThe authors have no conflicts of interest.\\n\\nFigure 1 Renal biopsy findings.

In the case of suspected hypersensitivity to local anesthetics, skin testing is considered to be a useful tool - patch tests and intradermal tests for delayed hypersensitivity and skin prick tests and intradermal tests for immediate reactions. There is a particular need for such a diagnostic procedure, as patients suspected of hypersensitivity to local anesthetic drugs are frequently admitted.\\n\\n\\nOBJECTIVE\\nTo highlight the problem of hypersensitivity to local anesthetics on the basis of authors' own experience and literature data.\\n\\n\\nMETHODS\\nWe present cases of 5 patients referred to the clinic by their dentists with a suspicion of allergy to local anesthetics, four to lidocaine and 1 to articaine.\\n\\n\\nRESULTS\\nIntradermal tests were positive in 1 out of 5 subjects, with a concomitant episode of urticaria. In 1 patient we obtained a doubtful result of intradermal tests. Skin prick tests and patch tests were negative in all cases. In 2 cases we performed an incremental challenge test also with a negative result.\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nIt has to be emphasized that, although rare, consequences of true allergy to local anesthetics can be serious considering a patient's future management and therapy. That is why this diagnosis may be crucial.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nLidocaine represents the most common local anesthetic (LA) agent employed in local or regional anesthesia, included as a constituent of EMLA, a eutectic mixture of lidocaine and prilocaine [1, 2]. Although most allergic reactions are due to the common metabolic product of the ester local anesthetic, para-amino benzoic acid, cross-reactivity among esters is common. Ingredients in LA solutions such as antioxidants or preservatives including metabisulphite or parabens may also elicit allergic or adverse reactions. Articaine solutions should be avoided in those allergic or hypersensitive to sulphite, due to the content of sodium metabisulphite as the vasoconstrictor's antioxidant in it. The LA (without preservatives or adrenaline) may be skin tested.\\n\\nTrue allergy to LA is rare, with a genuine immunological reaction representing only 1% of all adverse reactions to these medications [3–5]. In traditional classifications, adverse reactions to LA have been categorized as allergic, toxic and autonomic [3]. Most of the patients undergoing dental procedures exhibit some degree of autonomic response to an injection, such as sweating, tachycardia or even syncope. However, it is usually mild and transient. Toxic reactions are mostly observed as a consequence of a rapid intra-vascular injection of LA or may be associated with an overdose in patients defectively metabolizing the drug.\"], hint: None\n",

All patients were referred to our Department by their dentists with a suspicion of allergy to LA. In the case of 4 patients, lidocaine was suspected as a culprit drug; in 1 case, articaine was suspected.\\n\\nThree patients experienced an adverse reaction 2–2.5 months prior to diagnosis. In 2 subjects, the time interval between the reaction and diagnosis was much longer, being 17 and 25 years. Three patients had symptoms of an adverse reaction during a dental procedure involving the use of LA; 2 patients experienced an adverse reaction during tonsillectomy. In regards of the type of the adverse event, 2 patients experienced syncope, 1 had an episode of disseminated urticarial wheals and another had cardiac palpitations and anxiety. One female patient experienced an adverse reaction over 20 years earlier, for which there was no reliable documentation except the suggestion of a “severe immediate allergic reaction” by her family doctor.\\n\\nA thorough case history was recorded with the use of the Polish version of the European Network of Drug Allergy (ENDA) questionnaire [6, 7]. Skin prick tests (SPT) with chosen LA, followed by intradermal tests (IDT) were performed using 1: 10 000, 1: 1000 and 1: 100 dilutions for lidocaine and 1: 10 dilution for mepivacaine and articaine. We used LA preparations with no additional vasoconstrictors (e.g. epinephrine). All the procedures (STP followed by IDT if negative, dilution of examined medications) were performed thoroughly with the maximal safety considerations respected, especially in regards of possible immediate hypersensitivity reactions.\\n\\nHistamine and normal saline served as a positive and negative control, respectively. The SPT was considered positive when the mean diameter of an allergen wheal was equal or slightly larger than the mean diameter of the histamine wheal (+++) and when the mean diameter of an allergen wheal was at least twice as big as the mean diameter of the histamine wheal (++++) or in any case of response with pseudopodia (++++).

According to Wildsmith [10], among 25 patients initially diagnosed as being allergic to LA during dental treatment, 6 were diagnosed as suffering from phobia, panic or anxiety, 1 patient received an intravascular injection (adrenaline content of the cartridge), 1 patient appeared to be allergic to metabisulphite and latex allergy accounted for problems with 3 patients.'], hint: None\n",

In the majority of cases, hypersensitivity to this group of drugs may be excluded. It is suggested that the amide class of LA (lidocaine, mepivacaine, bupivacaine, articaine, prilocaine) is significantly less allergic than the ester type (benzocaine, procaine, tetracaine), There is also limited cross-reactivity between amide LA drugs [11]. However, according to data published by Zanni et al. [12], good agreement may be observed between clinical sensitization, PT and lymphocyte transformation test, indicating that there is a high degree of cross-reactivity between lidocaine and mepivacaine, also on the clonal level.\\n\\nAmong allergic reactions to LA, type IV hypersensitivity responses have been described predominantly to ester LA and clinically are represented by either contact dermatitis or rashes (macular or maculopapular) [13]. Torres et al. [14] also described the first case of fixed drug eruption induced by mepivacaine. This report was followed by others [15, 16]. Contact allergy to amide anesthetics is rare and, according to Klein and Gall [17] in 1991, only 18 cases had been reported since these medications began to be used in the 1940s. Most of the delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions take place after a topical application of the drug [18]. There have been also reports of cases presenting as contact dermatitis due to subcutaneous administration of LA, which have been confirmed by patch testing. Bircher et al. [13] described a case of a delayed-type reaction to LA with subsequent positive PT to lidocaine, mepivacaine and prilocaine but negative to articaine. Kanerva et al. [19] described a case of a 48-year-old patient, who developed contact dermatitis after an infiltration with mepivacaine and lidocaine and they concluded that diagnostic approach of a patient suspected of delayed-type hypersensitivity to LA should include not only PT, but also IDT.\\n\\nImmediate IgE-mediated allergic responses, particularly to amide type LA, are uncommon. According to some authors, in more than 30 years of their practice, there has never been verified an immediate allergic reaction to LA using available diagnostic technology [10]. However, there are case reports of adverse reactions to LA, suggesting type I hypersensitivity, where signs and symptoms tend to occur within minutes of drug injection and include urticaria, episodes of angioneurotic edema, wheezing, sneezing, pruritus or even anaphylactic shock [3, 10].'], hint: None\n",

The position of the line was confirmed with fluoroscopy and routine chest X‐ray (Fig 1).\\n\\nFigure 1 Chest X ray confirming the position of the central venous catheter.\\n\\nThe first cycle of chemotherapy consisted of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide.

This process causes cell death and continues to do so as more of the drug is released into the surrounding tissue, causing pain, as in the described case.2\\n\\n\\nThe topoisomerase II inhibitor and iron chelator, dexrazoxane, has been proven to prevent the potentially devastating effects of anthracycline extravasation. It is highly effective with minimal side effects and is well tolerated by patients.3 Dexrazoxane is approved by the Food and Drug Administration, but not the Therapeutic Goods Administration, and has limited availability in Australia.\\n\\nExtravasation is caused by mal‐positioning of central venous catheters, which can be classified as primary occurring at the time of placement, or secondary occurring sometime after placement. The causes of secondary mal‐positioning are poorly understood, as in our case, where initial investigation seemed to confirm correct positioning (Fig 1). Fracture and distal embolization of the catheter as part of the “pinch‐off” syndrome is far more common.4\\n\\n\\nBecause of the small number of thoracic extravasation injuries, there is no consensus on the most appropriate treatment, which is extrapolated from experience with peripheral access.5 Surgical procedures with the objective of draining the remaining solution after discontinuation of the infusion, along with dexrazoxane, must be considered as soon as possible to prevent major complications.\\n\\nSurgical options, such as percutaneous drainage, thoracoscopy, and open thoracotomy can be used. Unfortunately, the percutaneous option can cause subsequent complications because of the visual limitations of insertion, as in a case reported by Uges et al. where the percutaneous drainage was complicated by empyema.6\\n\\n\\nIn our case, we decided to use video‐assisted thoracoscopy to confirm the catheter position and to further assess the local tissue damage from doxorubicin. It also guided an accurate lavage of the cavity, the placement of the catheters that were used posteriorly for continuous irrigation, and helped to safely remove the mal‐positioned catheter (Fig 2).\\n\\nIn conclusion, combined early medical and surgical management of pleural extravasation of cytotoxic drugs, such as anthracyclines, is essential. Video‐assisted thoracoscopy can confirm tissue damage and aid drainage, lavage, and subsequent irrigation of the cavity.

Positron emission tomography-CT scans (Biograph™ TruePoint™ PET•CT; Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc., Knoxville, TN, USA) showed widespread metastases in the patient’s body on November 22, 2007 (Fig. 1).

The patient died of multiple organ failure in September 2009.\\n\\nDiscussion\\nFollowing ovarian cancer surgery, the patient exhibited disease-free survival for several years until the cancer recurred and a CT scan revealed widespread intra-abdominal metastases. The patient had concomitant diseases and developed massive ascites and pleural effusion. Treatment included IP chemotherapy and oral etoposide. These treatments were ineffective and the condition of the patient deteriorated further. To the best of our knowledge, no similar clinical case has been reported, and palliative care remains the recommended treatment for such cases (2,6).\\n\\nAscites disappear rapidly with bevacizumab treatment (7–9). In the present case study, massive effusion in the thoracic and abdominal cavity disappeared within a short time-frame subsequent to bevacizumab administration, thereby providing a basis for the next treatment. Bevacizumab was administered by IV infusion every two weeks and IP carboplatin was administered intermittently until the death of the patient. The patient was likely to have died earlier if pleural effusion had not been rapidly controlled; by contrast, the patient experienced disease-free survival for 25 months and treatment was associated with favorable results. Thus, bevacizumab may be concluded to play a key role in disease control.'], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: Epithelial ovarian cancer: A case report., context: ['Bevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin improves the progression-free survival of patients with ovarian cancer; however, it does not increase their overall survival time. Furthermore, the use of the drug in maintenance therapy subsequent to chemotherapy does not appear to increase overall survival (5). Other studies have indicated that bevacizumab does not increase overall survival in any cancer type, despite its ability to prolong progression-free survival (10–12). Thus, it was concluded that no overall survival benefit may be derived from bevacizumab. However, chemotherapy is contraindicated for patients with massive ascites, massive pleural effusions, breathing difficulties and poor performance status. Continuing chemotherapy in such cases may aggravate the patient’s condition and possibly lead to death. In the present case study, the patient’s ascites and pleural effusion disappeared following administration of bevacizumab, and a significant improvement in performance status was observed. IP chemotherapy combined with bevacizumab also led to extended disease-free survival. Thus, the role of bevacizumab in prolonging survival in patients with ovarian cancer warrants further study. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure of the patient rose continually until her death; such increases in arterial pressure may be associated with the use of bevacizumab.\\n\\nChemotherapy regimens for platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer include monotherapy with agents such as cisplatin and carboplatin, as well as combination therapies, including paclitaxel plus carboplatin, carboplatin plus gemcitabine and cisplatin plus gemcitabine (13–16). Other regimens may also be effective, including monotherapy with paclitaxel, docetaxel, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, oxaliplatin, melphalan, irinotecan, capecitabine, pemetrexed and etoposide, and hormone therapy with tamoxifen, anastrozole, letrozole, leuprorelin acetate and megestrol acetate (16–18). In the present case study, the patient received goserelin acetate implant, etoposide and megestrol acetate; however, these treatments were not efficacious. IP carboplatin was beneficial until the patient was no longer able to tolerate the treatment. Carboplatin was prescribed as it has a lower impact on the kidney than other drugs. This treatment strategy had a favorable outcome for the patient.\\n\\nBevacizumab rapidly eliminated the massive ascites and pleural effusion and achieved an effect that was not able to be attained with other treatments. Bevacizumab appears to be an effective means of controlling late-stage relapse and refractory ovarian cancer.

      "Predicting with title: The tacrolimus metabolism rate influences renal function after kidney transplantation., context: [\"The effective calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) tacrolimus (Tac) is an integral part of the standard immunosuppressive regimen after renal transplantation (RTx). However, as a potent CNI it has nephrotoxic potential leading to impaired renal function in some cases. Therefore, it is of high clinical impact to identify factors which can predict who is endangered to develop CNI toxicity. We hypothesized that the Tac metabolism rate expressed as the blood concentration normalized by the dose (C/D ratio) is such a simple predictor. Therefore, we analyzed the impact of the C/D ratio on kidney function after RTx. Renal function was analyzed 1, 2, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after RTx in 248 patients with an immunosuppressive regimen including basiliximab, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and prednisolone. According to keep the approach simple, patients were split into three C/D groups: fast, intermediate and slow metabolizers. Notably, compared with slow metabolizers fast metabolizers of Tac showed significantly lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) values at all the time points analyzed. Moreover, fast metabolizers underwent more indication renal biopsies (p\\u200a=\\u200a0.006) which revealed a higher incidence of CNI nephrotoxicity (p\\u200a=\\u200a0.015) and BK nephropathy (p\\u200a=\\u200a0.024) in this group. We herein identified the C/D ratio as an easy calculable risk factor for the development of CNI nephrotoxicity and BK nephropathy after RTx. We propose that the simple C/D ratio should be taken into account early in patient's risk management strategies.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nThe calcineurin-inhibitor (CNI) tacrolimus (Tac) is one of the most effective immunosuppressive drugs used for renal transplantation (RTx). In combination with mycophenolate mofetil, prednisolone and daclizumab, Tac regimen showed a superior graft function, better prevention of acute rejection and superior graft survival after 12 months compared to cyclosporine A and sirolimus [1].\\n\\nUnfortunately, Tac has a narrow therapeutic window. It can lead to acute as well as to chronic nephrotoxicity. Acute Tac nephrotoxicity due to high Tac levels typically presents early after RTx as e.g. isometric vacuolizations of tubular cells. In fact, even as early as one month after RTx, glomerulosclerosis in renal allografts can be associated to CNI nephrotoxicity. Typical chronic CNI-related allograft changes include tubule-interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy (IF/TA), tubular microcalcifications, glomerulosclerosis and artheriolar hyalinosis. Acute tubular damage can be reversed within the first three months after RTx, however, chronic lesions observed after the third month are usually progressive ones [2]–[4].\"], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: The tacrolimus metabolism rate influences renal function after kidney transplantation., context: ['Although there seems to be a strong association between higher CNI trough levels and nephrotoxicity [5], nephrotoxic effects of Tac can occur even at prescribed low-level regimens (4–6 ng/mL) [6]. In that context it is important that Tac metabolism depends on individual factors - clinical and genetic ones. Clinical variables like haematocrit, serum albumin, age, gender, body mass index (BMI) or absorption have been proposed to be significant influencing variables [7], [8]. However, some are still a matter of debate. The most relevant genes encode the cytochrome-P450 enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 leading to significant differences in Tac pharmacodynamics [9]. However, genetic profiling of patients is still far from been a routine test and the dosage needed to reach target Tac level varies in patients with known CYP3A polymorphisms over the time [10]. Of higher clinical relevance is that physicians have to take interactions influencing Tac metabolism into account when prescribing new drugs. In the transplant setting interactions with other immunosuppressive drugs, such as corticosteroids, sirolimus and everolimus are considered in daily routine. Nevertheless, the clinical relevance of these interactions remains widely unclear [11]. Yet another unanswered question of interest is, if the presence of CYP3A5 in the apical tubular plasma membrane observed in kidneys with CNI nephrotoxicity is causally relevant or not [12], [13].\\n\\nTherefore, factors which can predict patients’ risk to develop Tac side effects or promote clinically reasonable handling of Tac are of high interest to transplant surgeons and nephrologists.\\n\\nWe hypothesize that the Tac metabolism rate expressed as the simple blood concentration normalized by the dose (C/D ratio) is such a predictor.\\n\\nMaterials and Methods\\nStudy population and clinical data\\nWe analyzed data from 311 patients who underwent RTx between January 2007 and March 2012.

An induction therapy with basiliximab (Simulect) was given at day 0 and 4. Tac was started at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg bid with a target trough level of 7–12 ng/mL during the first month, 6–10 ng/mL from month 2 to 3 and 3–8 ng/mL for the following time. 1 g mycophenolate mofetil bid was administered and adapted in case of adverse events like leukopenia, diarrhea and infections. Prednisolone was started with 250 mg intravenous (i.v.) before and directly after transplantation, following 3 days of 100 mg i.v. per day. Then prednisolone was reduced by 20 mg per day. 20 mg/day was kept until the end of the first month.

Blood tests at that time (as indicated in Figure 1, day 23), showed undetectable HCV viral load, with new elevations of liver enzymes and she was advised to increase oral hydration for symptomatic relief. One week later (day 30), she presented to emergency room with complaints of profound weakness and myalgia along with ongoing nausea and abdominal pain. On physical examination, she appeared slightly dry, with slight periumbilical tenderness and without ascites. She demonstrated diffuse muscle weakness and muscle tenderness in all extremities. No focal neurologic deficit was identified. The admission labs (as noted in Table 1 and Figure 1, day 30) were noticeable for elevated liver enzymes, creatinine, and creatine phosphokinase (CPK). Urinalysis showed large amount of blood, without RBCs. Clinical diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis was made. Her atorvastatin was stopped and she was aggressively fluid resuscitated. CPK levels subsequently trended down and renal function returned to baseline. The workup for myalgia was unremarkable, with normal aldolase, C3 and C4 complement levels, TSH, and serum protein electrophoresis. Neurology evaluation was done, and EMG was done to evaluate for profound muscular weakness. EMG showed diffuse muscle irritability with no evidence of polyneuropathy, suggesting this patient had an inflammatory myopathy.\\n\\nRhabdomyolysis was considered likely from an interaction between Sof/Led, atorvastatin, and colchicine in the background of abnormal renal function. The rise of AST/ALT was considered to be from her rhabdomyolysis (nonhepatic). Colchicine was also stopped and she was continued on Sof/Led and low dose ribavirin with daily monitoring of her labs. By the time of discharge, her rhabdomyolysis resolved, with return of baseline GFR of 43\\u2009mL/min/1.73\\u2009m2.

In addition, the Sof/Led label does not mention many drug interactions; however both components are P-gp substrates [4]. Led is an inhibitor of the drug transporters P-gp and Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) and may increase intestinal absorption of coadministered substrates for these transporters [5]. Sof/Led is not recommended to be given with other known P-gp-inducers due to the potential for decrease in efficacy. Led can increase absorption of colchicine by P-gp inhibition and of rosuvastatin via inhibition of BCRP. Coadministration of Sof/Led with rosuvastatin can potentially increase the risk of statin related myopathy and rhabdomyolysis [6]. Sof accumulation in renal failure can also lead to toxicity and the patient should be closely monitored for liver failure if Sof is to be used in these patients. Additionally, colchicine has the independent ability to cause myotoxicity [7]. Sof/Led has not been noted to interact adversely with atorvastatin; however, a theoretical interaction exists via P-gp inhibition by atorvastatin, causing an increased level of led. Atorvastatin can itself increase levels of colchicine due to P-gp inhibition. Using colchicine in combination with a statin has been reported to cause myotoxicity, especially in the setting of CKD [8]. Atorvastatin 80\\u2009mg was used in this patient as it was used for secondary prevention for her coronary artery disease. A lower dose of atorvastatin was not attempted as the patient was symptomatic from her rhabdomyolysis and the patient was not having any active coronary artery disease.\\n\\nIn our patient, the addition of the Led in the presence of atorvastatin could have further increased the levels of colchicine, increasing the likelihood of muscle toxicity and causing rhabdomyolysis. Colchicine is renally eliminated and requires dose adjustments based on renal dysfunction. Thus, this patient's stage III CKD combined with a high colchicine dose and P-gp mediated drug interactions could have played a critical role in increasing the chance of this unanticipated toxicity [8]. There was little concern for mitochondrial toxicity caused by a lactic acidosis as the patient has a normal anion gap and normal lactate levels.\\n\\nThe Naranjo probability score [9] was developed to help assess causality for adverse drug reactions and based on score of 6 (Table 2) this patient's adverse event correlates with a probable adverse drug reaction. Although atorvastatin levels were directly measured, the muscle toxicity described was likely attributed to drug interactions in combination with preexisting renal impairment. Sof/Led was coadministered with two drugs known to cause myositis. Drug interactions, via P-gp inhibition, caused increased levels of all drugs, potentially increasing the risk of muscle problem development. It is important for physicians' prescribing Sof/Led to be aware of the potential drug interactions.\"], hint: None\n",

In addition, colchicine should be stopped, as there are other treatments for an acute gout flare (such as prednisone) that do not have a drug-drug interaction with atorvastatin and Sof/Led in causing rhabdomyolysis.

However, nicotine as a drug, and its effects on human psychology are largely under-investigated in genetic studies. In this study, we recruited 208 current non-smokers to evaluate the effect of nicotine and its relationship to genetic risks to nicotine dependence. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, as well as measurement invariance testing, were conducted to evaluate the latent factor structures of the POMS, PANAS and DEN questionnaires across 3 nicotine doses. Structural models were used to examine the effects of nicotine and their relationship to genetic risks of nicotine dependence. We found that nicotine administration led to the change of both measurement construct and factor means, indicating the causal effect of nicotine on the psychological responses. The genotypes of rs588765 predicted the scores of the DEN Confused and Dizzy factors (p = 0.0003 and 0.001 respectively), and rs16969968 and rs588765 were associated with the PANAS Nervous factor (p = 0.006 and 0.007 respectively). Our study suggested that genetic risk of nicotine dependence is associated with acute psychological responses. The integration of psychometric analyses and dose effects could be a powerful approach for genetic study of nicotine dependence.\\n\\nIn the last several years, genetic studies of smoking and nicotine dependence have made significant progress, exemplified by the identification of the CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4 locus.

This locus includes the CHRNA5, CHRNA3 and CHRNB4 genes. While a non-synonymous SNP, rs16969968, in the CHRNA5 gene has emerged as a functional candidate, it may not be the one tagging the strongest association signal12.

      "Predicting with title: Genetic risks to nicotine dependence predict negative mood and affect in current non-smokers., context: ['Nicotine, the primary psychoactive substance in cigarette smoke, has broad psychological effects on humans14. When first exposed to nicotine, either by smoking or other routes of administration, some people feel pleasant and relaxed, while others feel dizzy and nauseous. These initial responses to nicotine have significant impacts on sustained smoking and subsequent development of nicotine dependence15161718. However, in a typical genetic study, the psychological effects of nicotine are rarely utilized and included in association testing. This omission is due, in part, to the fact that little is known of the relationship between these effects and genetic risks of nicotine dependence. In the literature, there are a few reports on the association between subjective measures and genetic variants in the nicotinic receptors, and some nominal associations are found in the CHRNB3/CHRNA619 and CHRNB220 genes. These studies use the scores of individual items or several items that contribute to a common factor, but these studies do not control for measurement errors and correlations between items, and do not have nicotine dose effect information.\\n\\nPsychometric analysis with structural equation modeling provides a framework for constructing latent factor structures that can take into account measurement errors, item residual correlations and the degree of invariance across multiple waves of data simultaneously. In theory, it can identify and differentiate “true” treatment responses from confounding effects, attribute responses directly to experimental treatments (nicotine administration and dosage), and permit the test of genetic effects on these responses. Thus, integration of structural modeling with association testing may improve statistical power when well targeted hypotheses are postulated. To demonstrate the utility and advantage of this approach, we conducted a pilot study to evaluate the relationship between genetic risks of nicotine dependence and the subjective responses resulting from nicotine administration. We hypothesized that genetic risks of nicotine dependence contributed to subjective responses, and that by integrating psychometric modeling of psychological effects and dose effects we could improve statistical power to detect this genetic association. In a lab setting, we recruited 208 non-smokers, and measured their psychological responses via self-report by the Profile of Mood State (POMS)21, the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS)22, and the Direct Effects of Nicotine scale (DEN)23 after administration of each of a series of nicotine doses.

Towards these goals, we needed first to examine the latent factor structures of the items of the instruments, and to evaluate whether the latent measurement factor structures remained equivalent (i.e. statistically invariant) after the administration of different nicotine doses using measurement invariance (MI) testing procedures. A failure in the MI testing would provide evidence that the latent factor(s) and the individual differences they represent were not constructed equivalently across the nicotine administrations, i.e., individual differences on the latent factors were not calibrated in the same way across administrations, presumably due to differential item responses attributable to the administration of different amounts of nicotine.

His vision was recorded as having no light perception. The RAPD was found to be 4+. The fundus was examined under full pupillary dilation. The retina appeared normal, and the optic disc was not edematous. In the afternoon, the patient's visual acuity (VA) was improved to 3-m count-finger. On the second postoperative morning, the patient's VA was improved to 4/10. Vision assessment on the early morning of the third postoperative day was surprising. The patient's VA had improved to 20/20 without RAPD, and all other ocular examinations were normal.\\n\\nDiscussion\\nThe preferred technique for cataract surgeons in the United States is topical anesthesia (37%; range 22–63%). In a survey conducted by David Learning,1 76% of respondents preferred using topical anesthesia with intracameral lidocaine injection. Intracameral unpreserved lidocaine augments analgesia and significantly decreases intraoperative pain perception. Lidocaine is a useful adjunct, particularly in cases involving pupillary manipulation and peripheral iridectomy.\\n\\nWhile lidocaine has been reported to be safe and effective,2, 3 temporary visual loss4, 5, 6 and retinal toxicity4, 6 following the use of intracameral lidocaine have been highlighted in recent reports. An increased possibility of adverse effects of lidocaine on the retina and optic nerve is introduced in the event of compromise to the posterior lens capsule.4\\n\\nOur patient had experienced transient visual loss while receiving intracameral lidocaine and had an associated posterior capsule rupture, which has an incidence of between 26% and 36% in posterior polar cataract surgeries.7, 8 Normally, during cataract surgery, the lens capsule, zonules, and vitreous humor have a barrier effect against instilled intracameral lidocaine, and hence, the retina will not be affected. Pars plana lensectomy and vitrectomy facilitate the diffusion of the lidocaine into the posterior chamber.4\\n\\nGills et\\xa0al.9 reported amaurosis in four patients following the use of intracameral lidocaine, and in each case, the posterior capsule was not intact. All four patients recovered completely within hours. Hoffman and Fine4 reported on a patient with complete visual loss after intracameral lidocaine to repair a traumatic corneal graft dehiscence with a capsular tear, which was fully recovered several hours postoperatively. Falzon et\\xa0al.10 reported a case of transient, complete loss of vision following phacoemulsification with an intracameral ophthalmic viscosurgical device (OVD) and lidocaine solution complicated by posterior capsule rupture, which improved to 20/80 after one day and 20/25 in one week.\\n\\nFull recovery of visual acuity in our patient required three days, in contrast to the majority of reports (Table 1) with capsular tear4, 9 that had complete VA improvements within hours. The longer time span in recovery of VA in our patient might be explained by a higher volume of lidocaine that was diffused in the vitreous.\"], hint: None\n",

This inhibition is probably due to an anesthetic-induced disruption of intercellular ionic balance and increased plasma membrane permeability. Furthermore, intravitreal injection of lidocaine has also been investigated in cats, rabbits, and rats.6, 12, 13 In these animal studies, the electroretinogram analyses revealed a reversible reduction in the amplitude and extinguished b-waves which fully recovered within 10–24\\xa0h. In cats, intravitreal injection of lidocaine has been followed with vacuolization of nerve layers and presence of microscopic lesions in synapses between horizontal, bipolar cells, and photoreceptors. In addition, histopathological retinal structure changes near the injection sites have been detected.\\n\\nOne limitation of our study is that the patient did not consent to perform the ERG and mfERG tests. However, in the presence of positive RAPD, normal retinal examination, and full recovery of vision, the most plausible cause of vision loss would be attributed to lidocaine retinal toxicity. In view of the above, when posterior capsular rupture occurs, it is wise not to repeat intracameral lidocaine to minimize potential retinal toxicity risks.\\n\\nFunding\\nThe authors did not receive any financial support from any public or private sources.

The safe upper limit for daily dosing has variably been thought to be 4000 mg/day or possibly less.2 Excessive APAP dosing can occur with intent of self-harm (suicide attempt) or unintentionally while seeking pain relief, typically for a period of several days by using increased amounts each day.3, 4 Early on, an association was made between alcohol abuse and APAP unintentional overdoses, referred to initially as therapeutic misadventure.5 Both intentional and unintentional APAP overdoses have been shown to be associated with substance abuse of both alcohol and opioids, particularly the opioid (hydrocodone/acetaminophen) combination products.6 In 1 study of 275 APAP-related ALF patients, 55% had a history of alcohol use and 35% a history of alcohol abuse, and 53% had taken an opioid-APAP combination product.4 In a follow-up study of a larger cohort of 306 APAP toxicity survivors, 55% had a history of psychiatric disease compared with only 27% of non-APAP survivors, 46% of APAP patients had a history of prior substance abuse vs 15% of non-APAP patients, and 14% had a specific history of injection drug use vs 8% for the non-APAP group.7 Understanding what determines these behaviors might lead to better identification of high-risk patients and development of prevention strategies.\\n\\nWith either intentional or unintentional etiologies, critical behavioral differences could lead to high-risk behaviors. Impulsivity is a character trait defined as “acting suddenly in an unplanned manner to satisfy a desire,” ie, not thinking things through to understand the potential impact of a decision. More recently, impulsivity has been recognized as a measurable trait that is correlated with a variety of addictive behaviors.8 We have recently shown that higher impulsivity scores on the Barratt impulsivity scale are detected in both intentional and unintentional APAP overdoses when compared with control populations (Sanders C, Lee WM, unpublished data, submitted for publication).'], hint: None\n",

We hypothesized that this polymorphism or others that are related may have an impact in patients with APAP overdoses, especially in patients who have multiple substance dependencies. Furthermore, we speculated that the genetic association may be stronger or more apparent in subjects with intentional APAP overdose compared with those with nonintentional overdose. Thus, variations in several of these genes that alter the host’s ability to respond to stressful situations may indeed correlate with the observed tendency of addictive behavior.\\n\\nThe Acute Liver Failure Study Group (ALFSG) (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00518440) has been prospectively identifying and studying the etiologies, presenting features, and clinical outcomes of adults with ALF during the past 17 years while collecting biosamples—serum, plasma, and DNA. During this time period, ALFSG has enrolled more than 3000 subjects in its registry, 46% of whom suffered from severe or fatal APAP liver injury. Because stress and the response to stress are closely linked to addictive behavior and APAP toxicity patients have frequently been identified as substance abusers, we sought to determine whether specific variants in stress-related genes are over-represented in an APAP overdose cohort compared with population controls. By using DNA from 229 of these APAP subjects, we sought to identify whether selective variants in genes related to stress/impulsivity and addiction are associated with APAP overdose cases, because these findings might shed light on the patients’ tendency to abuse APAP products.\\n\\nMethods\\nPatients'], hint: None\n",

Here, we briefly introduce the case of a patient with latent autoimmune diabetes who developed SPS through the action of subcutaneously injected insulin. A 43-year-old man was diagnosed with diabetes and initially well-controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents but progressed to requiring insulin within 1 year of diagnosis. Two months after the initiation of basal insulin therapy, he presented with abdominal stiffness and painful muscle spasms, involving the lower limbs, which resulted in walking difficulty, and thus, he refused insulin injections thereafter. He had been treated with oral anti-diabetic agents instead of insulin for 10 years until premixed insulin twice daily was started again due to poor diabetes control. Immediately after insulin injection, abdominal muscle rigidity and spasms were noted. When insulin was not administered, frequent episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis occurred. Serum GAD antibody test was positive and there was no positivity for islet antigen-2 antibody. A glucagon stimulation test demonstrated relative insulin deficiency, indicative of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA).

      "Predicting with title: Exogenous Insulin Injection-Induced Stiff-Person Syndrome in a Patient With Latent Autoimmune Diabetes: A Case Report and Literature Review., context: ['Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a rare autoimmune neurological disorder and highly associated with glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody (GAD-Ab) positivity. Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the predominant inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. In the neuron, GABA is synthesized in the cytosol from its precursor glutamate by the enzyme glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) and then transported into the synaptic vesicles (1–3). The blockade of GAD, a critical enzyme involved in inhibitory pathways, and subsequent decline in the levels of GABA in the central nervous system have been suggested to be associated with a loss of neural inhibition, although evidence for a causative link between GAD antibodies and SPS pathogenesis is still lacking (1). GAD is the rate-limiting enzyme for the synthesis of GABA. SPS is characterized by progressive muscle stiffness, rigidity, and spasm involving the truncal and proximal limb muscles, resulting in severely impaired ambulation (4). It is suspected that the symptoms of SPS get precipitated by external stimuli, such as sounds, stress, and emotional upheaval (1, 5). The diagnosis of SPS is based on the detection of typical clinical findings, GAD antibody positivity, and suggestive ancillary investigations. GAD is also found in non-neuronal tissues, such as pancreatic beta cells, testes, and oviducts, so SPS is also associated with other endocrine disorders (6, 7). It has been shown that ~45% of patients with SPS have type 1 diabetes (T1D), which is an autoimmune disease characterized by the immune-mediated loss of the insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells (1, 5, 8, 9). SPS and T1D share human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genetic risk, with most SPS patients possessing the DQ2 phenotype (10). Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) shares clinical and metabolic characteristics with both T1D and type 2 diabetes (T2D). According to the criteria of LADA diagnosis, LADA is defined by the absence of insulin requirement for at least 6 months after diagnosis and exhibits an older age of onset, as well as a slower progression toward insulin dependence compared to subjects with T1D (11, 12). LADA in SPS is rarely described (13). Here, we reported a case of SPS in a patient with LADA. To our knowledge, this is the first report of SPS described shortly after the initiation of insulin therapy that required to split the administration of basal insulin into two separate injections (with lower amounts of insulin units per each injection) to achieve tolerable muscle symptoms and better glucose control, without the development of diabetic ketoacidosis.\\n\\nCase Report'], hint: None\n",

However, within 1 year, he was started on subcutaneous insulin injections (Insulatard, isophane Neutral Protamine Hagedorn human insulin, twice daily). Two months after the initiation of insulin therapy, he presented with abdominal stiffness, painful spasms extending to lower limbs, and impaired walking ability. Neurological examination showed muscle rigidity and bilateral contractures in the lower limbs but no muscular weakness. Electroencephalography was normal, and electromyography/nerve conduction velocity revealed slightly asymmetrical motor and sensory polyneuropathy with demyelination. These features were highly indicative of SPS. Therefore, diazepam (10 mg/day in two divided oral doses), clonazepam (2 mg orally four times daily), baclofen (10 mg two times daily), and phenobarbital (30 mg two times daily) were administered to treat muscle rigidity.\\n\\nThe patient's symptoms of jerky myoclonus-like movement, abdominal stiffness with painful spasms, and muscle rigidity were exacerbated by sound, anxiety, and subcutaneous insulin injections, regardless of the treatment regimen (Insulatard or regular insulin). Thus, he refused insulin therapy, resulting in poor glycemic control for 10 years, which resulted in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values persistently >8.0% (64 mmol/mol) with only oral anti-diabetic drugs (metformin 2,000 mg/day, sitagliptin 100 mg/day, glimepiride 8 mg/day, and acarbose 200 mg/day). Therefore, basal insulin (insulin glargine, 0.43 IU/Kg/day) with oral anti-diabetic agents (metformin 1,500 mg/day and gliclazide MR 240 mg/day) followed by premixed insulin twice daily (Humalog Mix 25, 0.71 IU/Kg/day) or a basal-bolus injection regimen (insulin detemir 0.17 IU/Kg/day and insulin aspart 0.13 IU/Kg/day) were introduced since 2015. He consistently experienced muscle rigidity with subcutaneous insulin injections every time. His fear and anxiety of re-experiencing muscle stiffness resulted in poor compliance with the prescribed therapeutic regimens. Finally, he experienced two episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis in 2017 (BMI was 22.45 kg/m2) and the laboratory results are summarized in Table 1.

The presence of high-titers of GAD autoantibodies has been reported in more than 85% of patients with SPS (1, 14, 15). GAD is involved in the synthesis of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma aminobutyric acid in the central nervous system (CNS). Dysfunction of GABA input in motor neurons causes stiffness, rigidity, and painful spasms (16). GABAergic neuron dysfunction has also been reported in epilepsy, and 10% of patients with SPS have some form of epilepsy (1, 16). From preclinical and animal models, it has been hypothesized that autoimmune responses against GAD in pancreatic islet deplete this enzyme and reduce GABA levels within the GABAergic system in the endocrine pancreas, thus promoting the progression of T1D. Moreover, GABA has been shown to exert β-cell regenerative effects, protecting β-cells against apoptosis induced by cytokines, drugs, and other stresses, and exerting anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory effects (17). The GAD-Abs are believed to play a role in the possible relationship between epilepsy and T1D (18). Two major isoforms of GAD enzyme exist, namely GAD65, and GAD67, which catalyze the formation of GABA at different locations in the cell and different time periods of development. GAD65 is attached to the surface of synaptic vesicles in GABAergic neurons or microvesicles in the pancreatic beta-cells, while GAD67 is a soluble form detectable only in the CNS (19). Anti-GAD antibodies are detected in up to 80% of SPS patients, while antibodies against the GAD67 isoform occur in <50% of patients and at much lower levels (19, 20).'], hint: None\n",

The inflammation and the impaired oligodendrocyte function lead to neuronal dysfunction and precipitate cell death. The misfolded α-synuclein exhibits prion-like properties and can spread to other brain areas. Depending on the affected site the clinical presentation varies: striatonigral degeneration presents as parkinsonism with poor response to levodopa, olivopontocerebellar atrophy with cerebellar syndrome and degeneration of the brain stem and the medullary autonomic nuclei with failure of the autonomous system.\\n\\nIn our report, we describe a 55-year-old female MSA patient, presenting with a persistent febrile syndrome, who was diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).\\n\\n2 Case presentation\\nA 55-year-old female patient of Greek origin was admitted in our hospital due to a recurring febrile syndrome up to 39oC during the week before the admission for which the family physician had prescribed ciprofloxacin for presumptive urinary tract infection in the context of intermittent bladder catheterizations without resolution of the symptoms.\\n\\nThe patient was diagnosed with probable MSA with onset 2 years before presentation. Initially, urinary incontinence was attributed to genitourinary syndrome of menopause and due to failure to manage with medical treatment the patient resorted to intermittent bladder catheterization. Symptoms progressed with frequent falls and documentation of orthostatic hypotension and finally, parkinsonism. The disease was not responsive to levodopa treatment and a DaT scan was not consistent with Parkinson's disease.\\n\\nPatient history was also notable for asthma, hypothyroidism, depression, placental abruption, and endoscopic resection of multiple benign colon polyps.\\n\\nAt presentation the patient was unwell without any specific complaints and febrile with marked orthostatic hypotension and normal oxygen saturation. Clinical examination was unremarkable except for the neurological status where no modifications with respect to the patient's baseline were noted. The complete blood cell count on admission was notable for normocytic anemia with low reticulocyte count (Hemoglobin 9.8\\u200ag/dl). Renal function was normal and hypokalemia (K 2.9 mEq/l) as well as hyponatremia (Na 128 mEq/l) with low specific gravity as a surrogate for urine osmolality and low urine sodium (21 mEq/l) were documented.

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Non-Commercial, No Derivatives (CC BY-NC-ND) license.\\n\\nResistance to antipsychotic treatment is defined as failure to respond to two antipsychotics of adequate dose and duration1 and occurs in 30% of individuals with schizophrenia.2 Clozapine is the only medication with evidence-based effectiveness in treatment-resistant schizophrenia,1 being effective in 50–60% of cases,3 but is also associated with a broad range of adverse effects. A commonly accepted risk is clozapine-induced blood dyscrasia, typically neutropenia or agranulocytosis. Neutropenia is defined as a neutrophil count of less than 1.5×109/L, occurring at a rate of 2.7% of clozapine users at 1 year.4 Patients who develop neutropenia may develop flu-like symptoms such as sore throat and pyrexia, with the peak risk occurring at 6–18 weeks. Less common is agranulocytosis, a life-threatening event defined as a neutrophil count of less than 0.5×109/L, occurring in approximately 0.8% of clozapine users at 1 year.4\\n\\nDispensing of clozapine is dependent on a satisfactory full blood count (FBC) result and maintenance of normal white blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil counts during clozapine treatment. In established clozapine-induced neutropenia or agranulocytosis, clozapine is immediately discontinued, and given the increased risk of recurrence,5 re-challenge is contraindicated. However, re-challenge may be attempted under certain conditions, for example, due to an alternative cause of the reduced neutrophil count being identified, or after careful assessment of the clinical risks and benefits. This process involves collaboration with a haematologist and may involve the co-administration of lithium or granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCS-F) in an attempt to promote granulocyte proliferation and increase the WBC and neutrophil counts. Despite carefully controlled re-challenge, a third of patients will develop a further blood dyscrasia, which is often more rapid in onset and more severe.5\\n\\nIn this report, we add to the limited existing evidence of successfully re-challenging clozapine for a third time with a patient with treatment-resistant schizoaffective disorder, following two episodes of agranulocytosis and one of episode of neutropenia.\\n\\nCase report'], hint: None\n",

She was born and raised abroad before moving to the UK at the age of 21 years. J.B. first presented with psychotic symptoms at the age of 19 years. Over the next decade, she had multiple admissions to psychiatric hospitals, both informally and under Section 3 of the Mental Health Act. Her illness was characterised by mixed affective episodes associated with persecutory delusions, thought disorder and auditory hallucinations, often triggered by stress or periods of non-adherence to medication. During admission to our service, persecutory beliefs were about other patients, staff and visitors, and led to accusations of theft of her belongings, accusations of sexual assault and physical aggression. Periodically, she became suspicious about the side-effects of medications and declined to adhere to their administration. There was a significant labile component to her mood, fluctuating between laughing and verbal or physical aggression. Between episodes, J.B. was pleasant, engaged in recovery-oriented practices and appeared less preoccupied and distressed by positive psychotic symptoms.\\n\\nDuring the first 7 years of her illness, J.B. was treated with multiple antipsychotics (i.e. quetiapine, aripiprazole, risperidone, olanzapine, amisulpride, haloperidol, sulpiride, zuclopenthixol decanoate and flupentixol decanoate), mood stabilisers (lithium carbonate and sodium valproate) and a course of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) with minimal improvement documented in case notes.

At this time, she was also receiving quetiapine and sodium valproate. Pre-treatment FBC showed a WBC count of 5.8×109/L and a neutrophil count of 2.9×109/L. WBC and neutrophil counts remained within normal limits until week 17, when J.B. developed agranulocytosis with a nadir WBC count of 2.0×109/L and a neutrophil count of 0.41×109/L. The daily dose of clozapine was 300 mg, with a plasma clozapine concentration of 0.17 mg/dL. Clozapine was immediately stopped and olanzapine was commenced as an alternative. The blood dyscrasia persisted for 19 days in total before cell counts recovered. Case records from the previous hospital indicated a significant improvement in her clinical state with clozapine, and discontinuation was associated with a rapid increase in her psychotic symptoms.\\n\\nTrial 2\\nA second clozapine challenge was initiated in February 2012. Sodium valproate was discontinued prior to the second clozapine trial. At this time, J.B. was concurrently treated with olanzapine 10 mg and lithium carbonate 300 mg daily. An FBC prior to re-challenge with clozapine showed a WBC count of 8.0×109/L and a neutrophil count of 4.4×109/L.

Following consultation with a haematologist, J.B. continued clozapine treatment with an additional dose of filgrastim 480 mcg given that day. This resulted in a good response, with the neutrophil count increasing to 19.2×109/L and the WBC to 23.10×109/L the following day. A plan was formulated to increase the frequency of filgrastim injections to twice weekly in the event of further neutropenia; however, this was not required.

In October 2014, following specialist consultations, the multidisciplinary team agreed collaboratively with the patient and family to re-challenge with clozapine for a third time under close supervision. She was deemed to have capacity to be part of each of these decisions. Following consultation with a haematologist and pharmacist, lithium carbonate was commenced prior to clozapine initiation, and weekly FBCs were measured over the first year of clozapine treatment. It was planned that in the event of the neutrophil count dropping below 2×109/L, a single dose of 105 mcg of lenograstim was to be administered subcutaneously, and clozapine was to be continued with daily blood monitoring. In the event of the neutrophil count dropping below 1.5×109/L, a single dose of 105 mcg lenograstim was to be administered, and clozapine treatment immediately terminated. Lenograstim was to be used in preference to filgrastim because of increased experience with its use in our clinical setting.\\n\\nPre-treatment FBC demonstrated a WBC count of 8.43×109/L and a neutrophil count of 5.7×109/L. Standard clozapine titration was carried out as per Maudsley Guidelines,7 and clozapine was increased to a dose of 550 mg daily administered in liquid form. Lithium carbonate at 1200 mg daily was concurrently used, with serum lithium levels of 0.55–0.95 mmol/L attained. Weekly FBCs across the first year demonstrated stable WBC and neutrophil counts, with no episodes of neutropenia or the need for rescue lenograstim. Consistently, therapeutic plasma clozapine concentrations of around 0.35–0.40 mg/L were attained, without further haematological complications despite continuation of clozapine, and a dramatic improvement in mental state was observed.\\n\\nDiscussion\\nOwing to the severity and distressing nature of this young woman’s psychotic and mood symptoms and the lack of response to a number of antipsychotic medications, clozapine was re-challenged following specialist consultations and close monitoring practices. The results were promising given the failure of three previous attempts and thus support the need for measured re-challenging and augmentation practices. In a recent systematic review, clozapine re-challenge was successful in 70% (78/112 patients) after an episode of neutropenia, with 20% (3/15 patients) successfully re-challenged after agranulocytosis.8 The co-administration of lithium (33/35 patients) or GCS-F (7/11 patients), in a targeted strategy, decreased the likelihood of developing a further blood dyscrasia.8 We reported previously that a clozapine re-challenge was successful in 79% of patients (n=19) admitted to our service.9'], hint: None\n",

The first trial of clozapine was concurrent with the use of sodium valproate. Sodium valproate can cause a dose-dependent inhibition of granulopoiesis,11 which when combined with clozapine may have led to the agranulocytosis. In the second trial, clozapine re-challenge occurred in combination with lithium carbonate. Lithium carbonate has demonstrated the ability to increase circulating neutrophils and granulocyte colony formation.12–14 Although a neutropenia occurred during this trial, it is interesting to note that the neutrophil count did not drop as low as seen in the first trial. During the third trial, J.B. was treated with concurrent G-CSF, and although agranulocytosis still occurred, neutrophil recovery was 1 day, which was significantly shorter than the recovery seen in the first and second trials. We are unable to explain this transient episode of agranulocytosis and the lack of any recurrent neutropenia over the following 7 months of clozapine treatment with concurrent G-CSF (with no G-CSF dose change). We cannot exclude that a transient increase in plasma clozapine concentrations was related to the onset of agranulocytosis (we have no data relating to plasma clozapine concentrations at that time, nor do we know if the patient had ceased smoking at or around this time). Alternatively, the presence of a viral infection may have contributed to the onset of agranulocytosis, though this was not clinically documented.\\n\\nDuring the fourth trial, lithium carbonate was used with therapeutic serum levels attained. Previous work has suggested that serum lithium levels greater than 0.4 mmol/L are required for granulopoiesis.14 Given the low dose of lithium carbonate used during the second trial, it may be that there were insufficient lithium levels to promote granulocyte colony formation at that time and that the optimal serum lithium levels in the fourth trial supported the maintenance of normal neutrophil counts.\\n\\nDespite neutropenia and agranulocytosis being well-documented complications of clozapine treatment, the mechanism of action remains unclear.15 There are several hypotheses, but due to its idiosyncratic nature it has been difficult to perform mechanistic studies to investigate these in a systematic fashion. Clozapine-induced agranulocytosis (CIA) has a large genetic component; genetic data suggest dysfunction in the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) system, which comprises genes that modulate immune system function. Recent work has suggested that there is an association with several genetic variants in the HLA-DQB1 locus, a single amino acid at HLA-DQB1 (126Q) and an amino acid change in the extracellular binding pocket of HLA-B (158T).16'], hint: None\n",

The immunosuppressive regimen included basiliximab induction and belatacept/mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)/corticosteroid maintenance. Belatacept was used because the kidney came from an extended-criteria donor [4]. Belatacept was administered intravenously, as recommended for the less intensive regimen (10 mg/kg on day 1 (D1), D5, week 2 (W2), W4, W8, W12; then beyond the third month, 5 mg/kg per month) [4]. During the posttransplantation period, the patient experienced multiple complications of viral reactivation, including cytomegalovirus disease at 7 months treated with valganciclovir; BK virus (BKV) reactivation at month 9 without polyomavirus-associated nephropathy on biopsy leading to a reduction in the MMF dosage (500 mg twice a day); and Epstein-Barr virus viremia at month 16 with no signs of a posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder. Fourteen months after transplantation, he received pulsed intravenous corticosteroids for cellular rejection (grade Ib). The estimated glomerular filtration rate stabilized at 53 mL/min per 1.73 m2 (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula).

His family described mood disorders and confusion, which had started the month before. He developed progressive right-sided hemiparesis with temporospatial disorientation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed left frontoparietal subcortical white-matter lesions, without gadolinium enhancement, suggesting no vascular disease occurrence. These lesions were consistent with demyelination and suggested PML (Figure 1A). Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy was confirmed by the presence of JCV deoxyribonucleic acid in cerebrospinal fluid ([CSF] 7.15 × 103 copies/mL) ( Figure 1A). At PML diagnosis, he had lymphopenia (421 CD3 cells/µL), with 276 CD4 cells/µL and 145 CD8 cells/µL (Figure 1A). He was HIV seronegative. Mycophenolate mofetil was stopped when PML was confirmed.

As controls, we used 3 healthy donors who were responsive to JCV. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were incubated overnight with a pool of JCV peptides spanning the entire VP1 and VP2 regions that activate both CD4 and CD8 T-cells [5]. Cells were stained for surface markers and then fixed and permeabilized before being incubated with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. As shown in Figure 1B, TNF-α secretion was severely impaired at PML onset.\\n\\nWe tested the ability of CD4 and CD8 T cells to proliferate in response to JCV peptides. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stained with 0.5 µM carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester and then incubated for 5 days with JCV peptides. Specific T-cell proliferation was very weak (Figure 1C). To measure JCV-speciﬁc cytotoxicity, PBMCs were coincubated overnight with JCV peptide-coated autologous target cells. As control, cells were coincubated with uncoated autologous target cells. The mortality rate of target cells was evaluated by 7-amino-actinomycin D staining. No specific cytotoxicity was observed in the presence of JCV-specific peptides (Figure 1D). Despite the patient’s treatment, his T-cell responses to JCV remained weak throughout follow-up with no significant change (Figure 1B–D). We also assessed the expression of the inhibitory receptor programmed death-1 (PD-1). We found that the patient’s T cells expressed high levels of PD-1 up to day 61 (1 week before death) both ex vivo and after in vitro activation (Figure 2A). We then examined the effects of a neutralizing anti-PD-1 antibody (nivolumab) on T-cell proliferation in vitro. Programmed death-1 blockade failed to reverse this T-cell anergy (Figure 2B). Of interest, we tested in parallel a transplant recipient patient who had been receiving tacrolimus, MMF, and corticoids since November 2014. This patient developed BKV nephropathy along with BKV viremia (8.4 × 106 copies/mL) and was treated by replacing tacrolimus with everolimus (an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin) in April 2015. T lymphocytes from this patient were nonresponsive to BKV in vitro (Figure 2B) and expressed significant levels of PD-1 after BKV peptide activation (Figure 2A).

Interleukin-7 induces widespread T-cell proliferation, increased T-cell numbers, and a more diverse T-cell receptor repertoire. We recently reported the case of a PML patient with profound lymphopenia after allogenic bone marrow transplantation, in whom r-hIL-7 led to the recovery of effective polyfunctional JCV-specific T-cell responses, virus clearance from CSF, and a favorable clinical outcome [7]. In this study, r-hIL-7 had no significant effect on the CD4 and CD8 T-cell counts. The subsequent CD4 cell recovery would be due more to MMF withdrawal. However, the CD8 T-cell count remained low. The patient had been on belatacept for 20 months, resulting in a long-term lack of CD28-mediated costimulation. Belatacept, which can provide significantly better renal function and both patient and renal graft survival than calcineurin inhibitor-based immunosuppression [8], provokes T-cell anergy in vivo [9]. The CD4 T-cell count recovery observed in our patient was not associated with improved functionality in terms of cytokine secretion, proliferation, or cytotoxicity. These functional abnormalities persisted for 60 days after PML diagnosis (the patient died 69 days after PML diagnosis) and were associated with strong expression of the inhibitory receptor PD-1. However, treatment with a therapeutic anti-PD1 receptor antibody (nivolumab) ex vivo failed to improve T-cell function.'], hint: None\n",

Although mucosal bleeding is the most common, fatal bleeding complications are also possible. Thus, F5D increases the difficulty of invasive testing, and surgical and procedural treatments. When long-term antithrombotic drugs, including antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants, are required in patients at high risk of bleeding, one of the biggest challenges is coronary intervention to treat coronary artery disease. Most studies recommend preinterventional or preoperative supplementation with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to reduce bleeding risk.[2,3] However, in addition to the bleeding risk caused by antithrombotic therapy, the hypercoagulable state in coronary intervention has an adverse effect on stent thrombosis, mortality, and prognosis during the postinterventional period.[4] The contemporary standard therapy for significant coronary artery stenosis is implanting a drug-eluting stent (DES). However, because implanting a DES delays endothelial healing and requires long-term antithrombotic therapy, DES implantation in an F5D patient is very complex. No antithrombotic therapy study to date has been reported for F5D patients undergoing coronary stenting.

She was not taking any medication except hypnotics, and her only cardiovascular risk factor was old age. Although she had had 3 natural childbirths, she had no history of surgery or blood transfusions. No specific findings were observed upon physical examination, electrocardiography (ECG), or chest x-ray imaging, and cardiac biomarkers were within the normal range, but the D-dimer, prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and activated PTT levels were prolonged. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a normal left ventricular ejection fraction and no regional wall motion abnormality.

FFP or platelet transfusion is recommended to control bleeding. In particular, transfusing FFP is recommended to maintain factor V activity at >25% to 30% in cases of bleeding, invasive testing, or surgery.[3,6] In this case, FFP was not transfused because coronary stenting was performed without knowledge of the degree of factor V activity or the existence of F5D. We recognized F5D due to hemoptysis, epistaxis, and hematochezia after coronary stenting. However, we first planned to reduce or modify the dosage of antithrombotic drugs due to the risk of stent thrombosis. This strategy was based on previous reports in which factor V activity was not related to bleeding severity.[2,6] Moreover, successful childbirth delivery was possible without an FFP transfusion, and the success rate for bleeding control was low with FFP transfusion.[3,6] Fortunately, mucosal bleeding in the present case was controlled by adjusting the antithrombotic drug dose. Treatments for the inhibitors or antibodies to factor V are another option and include plasmapheresis, immunosuppressants, steroids, intravenous globulins, and a monoclonal antibody.[2] Such therapies were not used in our case because the inhibitors and autoantibodies for factor V were unknown and such therapies have weak evidence.'], hint: None\n",

Clinically, it is characterized by severe cardiac arrhythmias including WPW syndrome, VT, and/or VF, dilated cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrest, and sudden death. Extra-cardiac features involving the nervous system and eyes have also been reported.4–7 DUFB11 variants have recently been independently proposed to cause histiocytoid cardiomyopathy. The efficacy of CA of PVCs triggering VF or polymorphic VT in idiopathic VF or channelopathies has been reported.2,3,8 Those PVCs could arise from the Purkinje system. Ablation therapy has also been reported in two cases of histiocytoid cardiomyopathy and VT, but the outcomes were far from satisfactory.9,10 The ablation target was the Purkinje tissue and anterior left bundle of His. One patient survived after a heart transplantation, and the other died of a cerebral haemorrhage after VAD therapy.9,10 Our case was a successful ablation of PVCs triggering TdP at the earliest ventricular sites. The patient died of uncontrolled heart failure due to cardiomyopathy 2 months later as a result.\\n\\nThe mechanism of ScTdP remains unclear, but it is assumed to be an unstable re-entry in the Purkinje network or triggered activity in the Purkinje cells. Histiocytoid cells are thought to correspond to abnormal Purkinje cells.11 In the case presented here, abnormal cells were occupying the subendocardium areas in both ventricles, while no fibrotic tissues were observed in those areas. Based on the pathological and electrophysiological findings, the PVCs were likely caused by triggered activity and associated with abnormal Purkinje cells. The perpetuation of the VT could have been caused by re-entry in the injured Purkinje network, because ablation of the narrow area in the RV suppressed the TdP.\\n\\nParticular attention should be given to the safety of CA in small patients. The expert consensus for CA is that VT with a deteriorating ventricular function is a Class I indication, even in infants, if medical therapy is not effective.1 We applied radiofrequency energy for 60\\u2009s for a total of 14 times at two different sites with the temperature control set below 55°C and a power limit of 30\\u2009W. Histopathology revealed the formation of transmural lesions replaced by fibrous tissue in the RV wall but not in the epicardium. This finding was quite satisfactory in terms of the adequacy of the depth of the ablation. At this level, abnormal cells associated with arrhythmias would have been eliminated without damaging the coronary arteries in the epicardium.\\n\\nConclusion\\nThe PVCs triggering TdP were successfully ablated in a 4-month-old girl with histiocytoid cardiomyopathy.

Despite of extensive pretreatment with radiation and conventional chemotherapy relapse occurred and was treated with sequential high-dose chemotherapy followed by transfusion of autologous peripheral stem cells. The high-dose chemotherapy course was complicated by refractory derailment of pineal gland insufficiency. The patient achieved a complete remission after high dose chemotherapy which lasted for 13 months. Subsequently, he developed a third relapse and died.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nTumors of the pineal gland are rare accounting for 0.4 - 1% of all primary tumors of the brain [1]. Different tumor types are found in the pineal region: tumors that derive from germ cells (germinomas and \"non-germinomatous\" germ cell tumors like embryonic carcinomas and teratomas), from parenchymal cells (pinealoblastomas and pineocytomas), and from glial cells are encountered as well as lesions that represent non neoplastic cysts [2]. In all series germ cell tumors represent the most common histology (60%) [2]. The peak incidence of germ cell tumors is in the second decade [3]. In contrast to the other tumors mentioned which have no sex preference, germ cell tumors are more frequent in men than in women [1]. First symptoms are often neurological signs and complaints caused by an obstructive hydrocephalus with headache, nausea, and vomiting and/or involvement of ocular pathways. Determination of histology, tumor markers in serum and CSF, and extent of disease are critical for optimal management of pineal region tumors. Five year survival rates following radiation range from 44 - 78% and depend on extent of disease, age, radiation volume and dose to the primary site but primarily on histology [4]. The five year survival of patients with germinoma is 76% as compared with 21% for those with a \"non-germinomatous\" germ cell tumor. \\n\\nThere is no established therapy for relapsing or refractory intracranial germinoma. In analogy to germinomas of the testis a higher curability may be expected with high dose chemotherapy followed by autologous blood stem-cell retransfusion [5]. For non germinomatous tumors no guidelines exist with respect to dosage, combination or sequence of chemotherapy and radiation.\\n\\nCase presentation\\nA 25-year old man became symptomatic by diabetes insipidus. Further examination revealed that these symptoms were caused by a primary AFP producing germinoma of the pineal gland.

Three weeks later chemotherapy according to the PEB-protocol was initiated: cisplatin 20 mg/m² i.v. d1-d5, etoposide 100 mg/m² i.v. d1-d5, and bleomycin 30 mg i.v. d1, 8, and 15. Four cycles were administered. In order to prevent bleomycin induced lung damage bleomycin was replaced by ifosfamide 1200 mg/m² i.v. twice daily (d1-d5) in two additional cycles.

Clinical examination and laboratory findings indicated a systemic process with cardiac involvement. Echocardiography revealed concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with enhanced echogenicity and preserved ejection fraction. Rectum biopsy confirmed amyloid deposition. The side effect of delayed diagnosis on prognosis and the appropriate diagnostic strategy has been discussed.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nLight-chain (AL) amyloidosis is a disorder characterized by deposition of insoluble, monoclonal immunoglobulin light-chain fragments in various tissues. Clinical features depend on organs involved but can include restrictive cardiomyopathy, nephrotic syndrome, hepatic failure, and peripheral/autonomic neuropathy. The patients often have a long period of a certain organ involved before systemic multiorgan involvement or heart failure has already developed. Cardiac involvement is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, especially in AL amyloidosis.1 Once congestive heart failure occurs in AL amyloidosis, median survival is less than 6 months if left untreated. Thus, an early and accurate diagnosis with an earlier start or more intensive treatment may have resulted in a better outcome.\\n\\nCase report\\nA 62-year-old male presented with a 15-day history of dyspnea on exertion, associated with both lower extremity edema.

Over the past 6 months, he developed a multiple system disorder, which included painless paresthesias in the lower limbs, erectile dysfunction, and chronic diarrhea. He had an average stool frequency of up to ten times per day, with no obvious blood or mucus and no abdominal pain or tenesmus. Unfortunately, previous stomach and rectum biopsy did not examine for accumulations of amyloid fibril protein. His family history was unremarkable.\\n\\nOn physical examination, his blood pressure was 82/56 mmHg and heart rate was 52 bpm. Significant jugular venous distention, moderate hepatomegaly, and lower extremity edema were noted. A neurological examination revealed weakness and muscular atrophy in the bilateral tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius. Hyporeflexia was noted on both knees and ankles.

An electromyography study demonstrated active denervation and chronic reinnervation changes in the tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius. Electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed sinus rhythm, low voltages in limb leads, QS waves in precordial and inferior leads, first-degree atrioventricular block, and prolonged QTc (Figure 1).

The major types of amyloidosis, classified on the basis of their precursor protein, include light-chain, senile systemic (wild-type transthyretin), hereditary (mutant transthyretin), and secondary (AA) diseases. The frequency of cardiac involvement varies among the types of amyloidosis and is common with AL disease.2 Myocardial amyloid involvement leads to a restrictive cardiac physiology with possible concomitant conduction system disease, and the patients may present with nonspecific dyspnea, lower extremity edema, and syncope.

      "Predicting with title: Light-chain cardiac amyloidosis with neuropathy: a case report., context: ['Echocardiography should be the first noninvasive test performed to evaluate for cardiac amyloidosis. Echocardiographic findings include biatrial dilatation and increased left ventricular wall thickness with diastolic dysfunction. Ejection fraction is generally preserved. These findings are also prevalent in other cardiac conditions such as hypertrophic nonobstructive cardiomyopathy. However, ECG of our patient revealed low voltages, which was not typical for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Increased myocardial echogenicity with a granular or sparkling appearance is the most characteristic feature, as seen in the case. But this feature has limited sensitivity in cardiac amyloidosis and may be more indicative of late-stage disease. Advanced echocardiographic techniques are beginning to reveal more about the underlying pathology and functional abnormalities. With the tissue Doppler imaging technique, measurement of myocardial tissue velocity allows detection of early diastolic wall motion abnormalities before development of heart failure. However, a limitation of tissue Doppler imaging lies in its inability to distinguish between actively contracting myocardium and adjacent tethered akinetic myocardial segments. This limitation can be overcome by strain and strain rate imaging, which derives from speckle tracking imaging and is better able to distinguish among segmental wall motion differences.3 It is particularly helpful and demonstrates a very typical pattern in cardiac amyloidosis, characterized by relative sparing of apical longitudinal contraction compared to basal contraction. This appearance is not typically seen in other cardiomyopathies such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and aortic stenosis.\\n\\nThe use of a combination of echocardiographic and electrocardiographic features increases specificity. A low voltage on the ECG and increased septal and posterior left ventricle wall thickness on the echocardiogram are highly specific for cardiac amyloidosis in the setting of biopsy-proven systemic amyloidosis. Low QRS voltages (all limb leads <5 mm in height) with poor R-wave progression in the chest leads (pseudoinfarction pattern) occur in up to 50% of patients with cardiac AL amyloidosis, and this is the most common finding in affected individuals. Ischemic cardiomyopathy may also result in decreased voltages and infarction pattern on ECG but leads to dilated, eccentric ventricular hypertrophy with reduced ejection fraction.

There are two types of amyloid that commonly infiltrate the nerve system. The first is familial amyloid polyneuropathy (also known as hereditary amyloidosis).6 The second is AL amyloidosis. Peripheral neuropathy occurs in 17% of patients with AL amyloidosis, making it the most common type of acquired amyloid polyneuropathy. Sensory-motor axonal polyneuropathy and carpal tunnel syndrome are the most common types of neuropathy associated with AL amyloidosis. Symptoms typically begin with painful paresthesias in the feet signifying small fiber involvement. As the disease progresses, it can affect larger nerve fibers and patients may complain of numbness and motor weakness.7 Up to 65% of patients with peripheral neuropathy also have autonomic nervous system involvement. The clinical manifestations of autonomic disorders are nonspecific and symptoms can include nausea, vomiting, early satiety, bloating, constipation, diarrhea, postural lightheadedness, and erectile dysfunction. Due to varying clinical symptoms, the diagnosis of amyloid neuropathy is often a challenge. However, it is important to recognize and distinguish neuropathy from diseases of the end organs themselves.

However many studies suggest different systemic effects related to PHPT, which could be enhanced by an abnormal cortisol release due to chronic stress of hyperparathyroidism. Being PHPT frequently found in the 6(th) to 7(th) decade of life, a careful and multifaceted approach should be taken.\\n\\n\\nMETHODS\\nWe report the case of an elderly patient with symptomatic PHPT and incidental pulmonary embolism. He was treated with hydration, zoledronic acid, cinacalcet and high-dose unfractionated heparin. Parathyroid surgery was successfully performed, but patient's conditions suddenly worsened because of a transient thyrotoxicosis, probably induced by a previous exposure to iodine load and/or thyroid surgical manipulation. A short-term treatment with beta-blockers was introduced for symptomatic relief. The patient also presented a transient hypercortisolism with elevated ACTH, likely due to stress related not only to aging and hospitalization but also to PHPT, resolved only four months after parathyroid surgery.\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nChronic hyperparathyroidism has been linked with increased all-cause mortality. A functional chronic hypercortisolism could be established, enhancing PHPT related disorders. Only parathyroid surgery has been demonstrated to cure PHPT and complications related, showing similar outcome between older and younger patients. However, the management of post-operative period should be more careful in fragile patients. In particular, the early diagnosis and treatment of a transient post-operative thyrotoxicosis could improve recovery. Due to the increase in prevalence and the evidence of many related complications even in asymptomatic PHPT, expert opinion-based guidelines for surgical treatment of PHPT should be developed especially for elderly patients.\\n\\nBackground\\nPrimary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is the third most common endocrinopathy seen today, frequently found in the 6th to 7th decade of life. PHPT mainly is a sporadic disorder, caused in 85% of the cases by a single adenoma, in 15% by multi-gland disease and rarely by parathyroid carcinoma. Less than 10% of cases are inheritable, often associated with multi-gland hyperplasia. The most common presentation of PHPT is an asymptomatic hypercalcemia, incidentally found on routine blood tests. However, many patients may suffer from minimal symptoms such as asthenia, constipation, polyuria, hypertension and neuro-psychiatric complications [1]. In some cases a renal colic is the first presentation of the disease. In older patients, concomitant morbidity and poly-pharmacotherapy may worsen symptoms and complications, and impact the management of PHPT [2].\"], hint: None\n",

The detection of hypercalcemia and elevated PTH levels was diagnostic of PHPT. The biochemical/clinical presentation could also raise the suspicion of parathyroid carcinoma, which was excluded by the histological examinations. Rehydration was the first measure to take in this patient, not only to correct dehydration and improve renal failure, but also to dilute calcium excretion. Bisphosphonate administration was effective in reducing calcium levels and bone resorption, in particular recent controlled trials demonstrated the superiority of zoledronate compared with previous treatments [3]. The addition of cinacalcet may be useful in the elderly or in not-surgical candidates, being well tolerated [4]. Parathyroid surgery is the only definite cure for PHPT, but the risks and benefits of surgery should be extensively considered in the elderly, given their more fragile state and co-morbidities [5]. Preoperative imaging with ultrasonography and scintigraphy may be helpful before elective surgery and in suspected parathyroid carcinoma, even if their sensitivity drops in detecting multi-glandular disease, as happened in our case report.\\n\\nOur finding of a transient thyrotoxicosis after parathyroid surgery could be due to a dual pathogenesis: a destructive thyroiditis and/or an iodine-induced hyperthyroidism. The first condition is fairly unknown and underestimated since the symptoms could be masked by other postoperative events [6]. Thyrotoxicosis seems to be related to an increased release of thyroid hormones and/or autoantigen during surgical manipulation, which could reactivate underlying autoimmune thyroiditis [7]. It could be influenced by other mechanisms, like preoperative hypercalcemic setting, pre-existing goiter and difficult parathyroid glands identification during surgical exploration [8]. Our patient had an euthyroid goiter, without abnormal MIBI-uptake in preoperative investigations nor previous or underlying autoimmune thyroiditis. Retrospectively, the only apparent risk factors were the goiter, the previous pronounced hypercalcemic condition and the occasional finding of a multi-gland disease.'], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: Transient hypercortisolism and symptomatic hyperthyroidism associated to primary hyperparathyroidism in an elderly patient: case report and literature review., context: ['The second possible cause of transient thyrotoxicosis could be related to the previous iodinated contrast media exposure, leading to hypersecretion of thyroid hormones. This phenomenon, known as the Jod-Basedow effect, usually develops over 2 to 12\\xa0weeks, typically in old patients with underlying thyroid disease or living in areas of iodine deficiency. Exposure to a large iodine load can also cause acute destructive thyroiditis in people without pre-existing thyroid disorders [9]. TcO4-scintigraphy could not discriminate the cause of hyperthyroidism, since pertechnetate is trapped by thyroid, but not organified and the resulting tracer uptake may be reduced. As happened in our case, the assessment of urinary iodine concentration may be helpful [10]. Some researchers have investigated the incidence and the role of prophylactic measures to reduce the risk of iodine-induced thyrotoxicosis, without conclusive findings [11]. In our case the concomitant neck surgery could have been a precipitating factor in the pathogenesis of hyperthyroidism.\\n\\nBoth these conditions are usually self-limited and anti-thyroid drugs are not indicated. However, a short-term treatment with beta-blockers could be required for symptomatic relief, especially in fragile patients.\\n\\nSince chronic hyperparathyroidism has been linked with increased all-cause mortality, in asymptomatic and elderly patients the optimal timing for parathyroidectomy is controversial [12]. Cardiovascular complications are the leading cause of this increased mortality [13], linked not only to mineral homeostasis disruption but also to a direct effect of PTH on cardiovascular structures [14]. The complexity of PTH functions is further highlighted by data suggesting a bidirectional link between PTH and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system, playing a synergic role in enhancing metabolic and cardiovascular complications [15]. Several studies have also evidenced an altered hypotalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in PHPT, potentially contributing to cortical bone damage [16]. In vitro evidence supports a stimulatory effect of PTH on cortisol secretion [17] and of calcemia on ACTH release [18]. In vivo data show a hypercortisolism, loss of circadian rhythm and lack of cortisol suppression after low-dose DST in PHPT [19], which are not always recovered after surgical cure, as happened in our case.\\n\\nAlteration of cortisol expression and its circadian variability are also typical of aging, hospitalization, psychiatric and stress conditions [20]. False-positive results of the 1\\xa0mg DST could be influenced by absorption, liver or renal alterations and the use of alcohol or drugs inducing CYP3A4. Being PHPT a long-standing disease frequently affecting old patients, the activation of adrenal function seems to recall a functional hypercortisolism due to chronic stress, which could be preserved by aging and other co-morbidities, enhancing the damaging effects of prolonged exposure to stress hormones [21].'], hint: None\n"

With rapid advancements in next generation sequencing technologies, there is more focus on HIV drug-resistant variants of low frequency, or the so-called minority variants. In South Africa, AZT monotherapy for pMTCT, similar to World Health Organization option A, has been used since 2008. In 2010, a single dose of co-formulated TDF/FTC was included in the strategy for prevention of resistance conferred by single-dose nevirapine (sd NVP). The study was conducted in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, among pMTCT participants who received AZT monotherapy from 14 weeks of gestation, intrapartum AZT and sd NVP, and postpartum sd TDF/FTC. Twenty-six specimens collected at 6 weeks post-delivery were successfully sequenced using 454 ultra-deep sequencing. Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) resistance was detected in 17 of 26 (65%) patients, 2 (7%) had Thymidine analogue mutations, and 3 (11%) had K65R. Of the 17 patients with NNRTI resistance, 11 (65%) had high-level NNRTI resistance, whereas 6 (35%) had intermediate NNRTI resistance. The levels of NNRTI resistance are much higher than would be expected, given the inclusion of antepartum AZT and postpartum TDF/FTC. This high level of NNRTI resistance could impact future NNRTI-containing treatment for a large proportion of pMTCT-exposed women. The detection of Thymidine analogue mutations highlights the need to understand the clinical impact of these on AZT-containing antiretroviral treatment in women exposed to AZT monotherapy.\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\nAlthough prevention of mother-to-child transmission (pMTCT) strategies have recently improved with the implementation of World Health Organization (WHO) options B and B plus,1 antiretroviral (ARV) drug resistance remains a significant problem in the wake of single-dose nevirapine (sd NVP)2,3 monotherapy and dual-therapy use in resource-limited settings. The current standard method for resistance testing is Sanger sequencing, or so-called population sequencing, and although widely used, it is limited since the sensitivity relies on mutations being present in 15%–20% of the HIV quasispecies.4,5 Thus, resistance conferring mutations present at low frequencies, or drug-resistant minority variants (DRMVs) will be missed by Sanger sequencing. The more sensitive technologies, commonly known as next-generation sequencing, include the Miseq and HiScan (Illumina, San Diego, CA), 454 GS-FLX and Junior (Roche Daignostics, Basel, Switzerland), Pac-Bio RS II (Pacific Biosciences, CA), and Ion-Torrent PGM (Life Technologies, Thermo Fischer Scientific, NY). Resistance testing performed using these technologies can detect DRMVs present at low frequencies.6 These DRMVs were shown to be clinically significant in studies investigating non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor–based ART.7,8 DRMVs doubled the risk of virological failure to first-line NNRTI-containing antiretroviral treatment (ART).9'], hint: None\n",

If the virus reactivates in the trigeminal ganglia, it can cause varicella zoster ophthalmicus, which can have severe ocular complications. We report a case of a 73-year-old woman in severe immunosuppression due to treatment with mycophenolate mofetil, glucocorticosteroids and a tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitor. The reactivation caused superior orbital fissure syndrome, which has only rarely been described in relation to varicella zoster virus reactivation. In our case, the syndrome was seen along with severe encephalitis.\\n\\nBackground\\nThe incidence of varicella zoster virus (VZV) reactivation is increased in immunosuppressed patients, and reactivation of herpes zoster is a common adverse event reported in clinical trials with tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitors (TNF-alpha) [1].\\n\\nVaricella zoster ophthalmicus (VZO) is caused by reactivation of latent virus in the trigeminal ganglion, and ocular complications may include blepharitis, keratoconjunctivitis, iritis, scleritis and acute retinal necrosis [2]. Another ophthalmological complication is ophthalmoplegia, which can be seen in relation to VZO, and there is a slight increase in simultaneous aseptic meningitis when VZO is accompanied by ophthalmoplegia [3].\\n\\nSuperior orbital fissure syndrome (SOFS) is rare in relation to VZO, but a closely related entity named orbital apex syndrome (OAS) has been correlated with the occurrence of VZO; however, only in a few cases [2,4]. In SOFS, there is no lesion to the optic nerve in contrast to OAS, in which the optic nerve is compromised, leading to reduced visual acuity [5].\\n\\nCase Presentation\\nA 73-year-old woman with active pyoderma gangrenosum was treated with both mycophenolate mofetil and glucocorticoids for years.

She became progressively encephalopathic and then unconscious. The patient died during assessment of complications related to her encephalopathy.\\n\\nDifferential Diagnosis and Tests\\nAt the initial workup, a computed tomography scan of the cerebrum including cerebral angiography was performed and found to be normal. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan with intravenous contrast and MRI venous angiography was carried out, revealing meningeal enhancement in the posterior fossa and the area around the cerebellopontine angle on the right side (fig. 2). This was strongly suspicious of basal meningitis, and a lumbar puncture showed 114 white blood cells with 96% being of lymphocytic origin. The cerebrospinal fluid was considered free of malignant cells and bacteria, but positive for VZV DNA on polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A PCR of the fluid from the right eye was also positive for VZV.\\n\\nTreatment\\nFrom the time of admission, the patient received intravenous treatment with acyclovir initially 750 mg three times per day, but the dosage of acyclovir was increased to 1,000 mg three times per day once the PCR for herpes virus family came back positive for VZV.

The severity of the zoster outbreak is correlated with the degree of immunoincompetence [6].\\n\\nMcDonald et al. [7] found a significantly higher risk of herpes zoster in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with TNF-alpha inhibitors compared with those treated with, i.e., sulfasalazine. The patients treated with TNF-alpha inhibitors, who developed herpes zoster, were subdivided into three groups, and a significantly higher risk was associated with the use of infliximab compared to etanercept and adalimumab. Another retrospective study showed significantly greater risk when using infliximab and adalimumab compared with no TNF-alpha inhibitor treatment [8].\"], hint: None\n",

[9] described a patient treated with mycophenolate mofetil who developed hemi-cauda equina syndrome due to varicella zoster meningoradiculitis. However, this patient also had renal function impairment, which is known to increase the risk of VZV reactivation [10]. The study by Koo et al. [11] on the incidence of herpes zoster reactivation in patients after heart transplantation showed treatment with mycophenolate mofetil as an independent risk factor for herpes zoster. Using glucocorticoids has also been shown to have a significant association with varicella zoster reactivation [12].\\n\\nSOFS consists of dysfunction of the oculomotor nerve (III), the trochlear nerve (IV), the abducens nerve (VI) and the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve (V1). If there is involvement of the optical nerve (II) as well, it is called OAS. The causes of both SOFS and OAS are many, i.e. inflammation, infection, neoplasia, iatrogenic, trauma and vascular conditions [5].\\n\\nThe ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve is purely sensory. It supplies the cornea, the skin of the forehead, eyelid and nose, and it gives off branches to the tentorium cerebelli, dura mater and the posterior area of the falx cerebri [4], possibly explaining a way for the virus to reach the brain causing encephalitis and meningitis.\\n\\nThe pathogenesis of OAS in relation to VZO is thought to be related to immune complexes, direct tissue infection with the virus and/or secondary vasculitis [4]. The same is likely to be true for the SOFS when it occurs in relation to VZO.\\n\\nFollowing reactivation of VZV in the ganglion and the spread along the first branch of the trigeminal nerve, direct tissue infection and an immune response may take place within the orbit. The immune response is both humoral and cellular, resulting in inflammation with clinical manifestations of pain, hyperemia, edema, heat and loss of function. It is mediated by the release of lipid mediators, cytokines and altered vascular permeability. The involvement of orbital tissue ipsilateral to cutaneous lesions supports the notion that the pathogenesis is likely to be due to direct viral infection in the orbital cells and a consequent immune system reaction. Circulating immune complex-mediated mechanisms could, however, potentially involve the contralateral orbital tissue resulting in the same symptoms [4], explaining the involvement of the other eye in our patient.\\n\\nThe viral replication of VZV is of short duration and confined to the early stage of the disease. Antiviral therapies should be administered early to have an effect. In our patient, the first symptom of retrobulbar pain was likely due to the onset of viral replication, and the antiviral therapy was administered at a late stage of the disease.

This case report highlights that herpes zoster does not always have a benign course, and caution must be taken for this category of patients. Immunologically incompetent patients with VZO should be treated with antiviral drugs at the first signs of reactivation in order to try to prevent secondary ocular complications.

Belatacept selectively inhibits T cell activation and was recently demonstrated to be superior to cyclosporin in patients with renal transplants in terms of renal function with equivalent survival[2]. Frequent adverse events associated with belatacept are anemia, disturbance of bowel habits and infections, especially urinary tract infections, with no need to stop treatment in most of cases. Here, we report a case of severe stricturing Crohn’s disease (CD)-like colitis due to belatacept administration in a renal transplant recipient.\\n\\nCASE REPORT\\nWe report the case of a 62-year-old man who received a first kidney allograft from a deceased donor in September 2013. His end-stage renal disease was attributed to chronic glomerulonephritis. After an induction treatment by thymoglobulin and methylprednisolone pulses, the immunosuppression regimen consisted of tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and steroids. There was no immediate complication after transplantation and the nadir of serum creatinin was 2.24 mg/dL. Rapidly, after two months, tacrolimus was withdrawn due to nephrotoxicity (histologically proven) and replaced with everolimus which was also stopped due to development of lymphocele and proteinuria. In February 2014, belatacept was started at a dose of 5 mg/kg intravenously every month in association with mycophenolate mofetil in order to decrease corticosteroids to the level of 10 mg/d.\"], hint: None\n",

In October 2015, because of worsening of the diarrhea, a stool culture was performed which was positive for Campylobacter jejuni. Antibiotics course was prescribed with some efficacy but the diarrhea persisted.\\n\\nIn February 2016, the patient was hospitalized for bloody stools with anemia and abdominal pain for which blood transfusion was necessary. A colonoscopy was rapidly performed showing large round shaped deep ulcers with normal surrounding mucosa. These ulcers were located in the caecum, transverse colon, left colon and sigmoid colon and were compatible with the diagnosis of CD (Figure 1). The terminal ileum and rectum were normal. Histologic examination of the colonic biopsies showed acute colitis with ulcerations, crypt abscesses, lymphocytes and neutrophil polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration. Neither crypt dystrophy nor granuloma was found (Figure 2).

A follow-up colonoscopy was performed in June 2016 which showed persistence of the large ulcers previously described and the appearance of a passable ulcerated inflammatory stricture at the left colonic flexure (Figure 1). Histologic examination showed acute colitis without signs of chronic inflammation (Figure 2). No signs of cytomegalovirus colitis were found on histology, such as owl’s eye inclusion bodies. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of colonic biopsies was positive for human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6) and negative for cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus. Also, PCR analysis for cytomegalovirus in the blood was negative. Belatacept was therefore withdrawn in June 2016 and the patient was treated with low dose tacrolimus for prevention of allograft rejection and an increased dose of steroids to treat colonic inflammation. In October 2016, the patient was free from diarrhea but described left-sided abdominal pain with partial obstructive symptoms probably due to the colonic stricture. The colonoscopy performed four months after belatacept withdrawal showed a complete healing of the ulcers in the left colon and a non-inflammatory stricture of the left colonic flexure which could not be passed (Figure 1). The stricture was not dilated as clinical symptoms were mild. PCR for HHV-6 was negative on colonic biopsies and only slightly positive on biopsies targeted to the colonic stricture. At the last clinical outpatient visit in January 2017 the patient was asymptomatic with no signs of acute renal rejection.\\n\\nDISCUSSION\\nWe have described here for the first time the case of a severe stricturing CD-like colitis occurring in a patient with a kidney allograft treated with belatacept. Gastrointestinal side effects are well known in renal transplant recipients receiving immunosuppressive therapy, especially mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). Indeed, MMF has multiple side effects and those affecting the gastrointestinal tract mostly occur during the first 6 mo after the onset of treatment[3]. These side effects include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, whereas bleeding is less reported. A recent retrospective study investigated endoscopic findings in patients treated with MMF having diarrhea. In most of the cases the colonic mucosa was normal and the common lesion was simple erythema without deep ulcer or stricture[3]. Our patient had diarrhea after introduction of MMF with liquid stools but no bleeding, and this diarrhea improved after MMF withdrawal. Although acute colitis was first thought to be due to MMF, appearance of bleeding, large ulcers without erythema at colonoscopy and worsening of endoscopic lesions after MMF withdrawal led us to suspect the involvement of belatacept.'], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: Stricturing Crohn's disease-like colitis in a patient treated with belatacept., context: ['Ipilimumab and tremelimumab, two therapeutic monoclonal antibodies against CTLA-4 and prescribed in cancer patients, have previously been implicated in the development of severe and extensive forms of inflammatory bowel disease with colonic ulcerations[4]. CTLA-4 is a homologue of CD28 that binds CD80 and CD86 with higher affinity, and thereby down-regulates T cell activation. Anti CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies block its interaction with CD80 and CD86 and favour CD28 engagement and consequently T cell activation and proliferation. The overactivation of the immune system in patients treated with anti CTLA-4 antibodies associated with a specific gut microflora may explain the development of treatment-mediated CD-like colitis[5]. Abatacept and belatacept are two recombinant fusion proteins comprising a fragment of the Fc domain of human IgG1 and the extracellular domain of human CTLAA-4. Similar to CTLA-4, abatacept and belatacept compete with CD28 for CD80 and CD86 binding to block co-stimulatory signaling, thus selectively modulating T-cell activation. In comparison to abatacept, belatacept confers higher affinity for CD 80/86 ligands and has a slower dissociation rates. It could also alter regulatory T cell development, which plays an important part in intestinal inflammation. Abatacept is effective for rheumatoid arthritis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis[6], and belatacept is currently used for kidney transplant rejection prophylaxis[1]. It has been showed that abatacept was not effective for the treatment of active ulcerative colitis and CD[6]. It may be surprising that belatacept induces CD-like colitis given it has the opposite effect from anti-CTLA-4 antibodies. However, cases of colitis have been also described in patients treated with abatacept (Table 1). A first case of ulcerative colitis was reported in 2006 in a 55 year old male patient treated with abatacept for rheumatoid arthritis[7]. The diagnosis of ulcerative colitis was made 15 mo after start of abatacept and digestive symptoms improved after abatacept withdrawal and mesalamine treatment. Two other cases of ulcerative colitis developing five and 23 mo after abatacept introduction in rheumatoid arthritis patients were reported. The first one was treated with mesalamine and infliximab and the second one with prednisolone and mesalamine[8]. Similarly to these case reports, the severe colitis occurred 23 mo after belatacept introduction in our patient. Macroscopically, the endoscopic lesions were more in favor of CD compared to abatacept-induced colitis, and the large deep ulcerations were similar to anti CTLA-4 enterocolitis. The histological findings in our patients described acute colitis with polymorph leucocyte infiltration and crypt abscesses without atrophy, distortion, branching or budding of crypts. These findings were also described in abatacept and anti CTLA-4 colitis. The most striking finding in our case is the development on belatacept treatment of an inflammatory stricture of the left colon. After belatacept withdrawal and pre'], hint: None\n",

It may be a direct effect of belatacept, which could alter the development of regulatory T cells, and therefore lead to uncontrolled intestinal inflammation. Another hypothesis may be an indirect effect of belatacept which confers a profound immunosuppression leading to the development of infectious colitis. Cytomegalovirus colitis was ruled out by careful histologic examination and negative PCR analyses in the blood and in colonic biopsies. PCR in biopsies was however, strongly positive for HHV-6. HHV-6 reactivation in patients with solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been reported to be associated with intestinal disease[9,10]. Moreover, HHV-6 was found in colonic mucosa of inflammatory bowel disease patients in 44% of the cases and associated with disease activity and use of immunosuppressive therapy[11]. HHV-6 intensity also correlated with endoscopic severity in ulcerative colitis. After belatacept withdrawal and mucosal healing, PCR for HHV-6 in colonic biopsies was found to be negative or slightly positive in our patient.\\n\\nThus, we report here a case of CD-like colitis in a patient treated with belatacept. Despite belatacept withdrawal, the patient developed a severe colonic stricture which may impact quality of life and necessitate subsequent colonic surveillance. Therefore in patients treated with belatacept who develop digestive symptoms such as diarrhea or intestinal bleeding, we recommend performing early colonoscopy and considering belatacept withdrawal in case of suggestive endoscopic and histologic findings.\\n\\nCOMMENTS\\nCase characteristics'], hint: None\n",

Recent advances in multiplex genotyping based on circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) provide a strong and non-invasive alternative for detection of the resistance mechanism.\\n\\n\\nMETHODS\\nHere we report a multiple metastatic NSCLC patient who was detected to have pure EGFR 19 exon deletion (negative for EML4-ALK and ROS1 in both IHC-based and sequencing assay) in the primary lesion and responded to first-line and second-line EGFR-TKI treatments (erlotinib then HY-15772). At 8 months, most lesions remained well controlled except for the liver metastases which presented dramatic progression. Considering the high risk of bleeding in rebiopsy of hepatic lesions, we conducted a multiplex genomic profiling with ctDNA. Results reported coexistence of EGFR mutation and EML4-ALK gene translocation in plasma which heavily indicated that ALK was the primary reason for progression of the liver lesions. This deduction was supported by the repeated response to ALK inhibitors (crizotinib then AP26113) of the hepatic metastases.\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nThis is the first report of the existence of ALK rearrangement in metastatic lesions in an EGFR mutated patient. It highlighted the feasibility and advantages of using ctDNA multiplex genotyping in identifying the heterogeneity across lesions and the resistance mechanism of targeted treatments.\\n\\nBackground\\nAdvances in geno-typing have changed the clinical practice of treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), especially non-squamous types where driver mutations, e.g. epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations and echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (EML4-ALK) translocation are commonly present. Agents that target EGFR activating mutations (gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib, etc.) or ALK rearrangement (crizotinib, etc.) derive significantly greater benefits than cytotoxic chemotherapy in patients who harbor these gene alterations, which is consistently proved by extensive large-scale randomized controlled trials [1, 2]. In order to deliver an appropriate first-line treatment regimen, detection of EGFR mutation and ALK rearrangement are recommended as routine genetic profiling for non-squamous NSCLC or non-smoking populations [3]. In recent years, some selective inhibitors that can overcome the resistance to first generation inhibitors of these driver alterations have also been developed, e.g., AZD9291 and CO-1686, some more effective inhibitors against both EGFR sensitizing and resistance T790M mutations [4]; or ceretinib, aletinib and AP26113, the agents that are effective for both ALK fusion and some secondary gatekeeper mutations [5].'], hint: None\n",

FISH, RT-PCR and Ventana IHC are all currently accepted methods for detection of ALK rearrangement. In recent years, the development and advances in high throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS) have allowed the simultaneous profiling of alterations in multiple genes [6]. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is released or excreted by tumour cells and circulates in the blood of a cancer patient; analysis of the fraction of mutant-alleles from ctDNA compared to normal-alleles from the patients’ normal genome provides opportunities for minimally-invasive cancer diagnosis and tumor monitoring [7]. Detection with ctDNA, which originates from all potential lesions, could overcome the disadvantages of single site biopsy given that the intra-tumoral and inter-lesional heterogeneity is common [6, 8]. Enrichment of plasma ctDNA and incorporation with the next generation deep sequencing techniques allow us to simultaneously detect the gene alterations of interest, e.g. EGFR/BRAF/HER2 mutations, ALK/ROS1/RET rearrangements, MET amplification, etc. in NSCLC, especially when it is difficult to obtain sufficient tissue samples.\\n\\nEGFR mutations and ALK rearrangement are generally considered to be mutually exclusive. However, some recent surveys and case reports showed co-existence of the two alterations within the same lesion [9, 10].

This special case highlights the feasibility and necessity of using ctDNA multiplex genomic profiling as an alternative approach in molecular diagnosis of NSCLC or in the exploration of the underlying mechanism in resistance to targeted therapies.

Metastatic hepatic lesions were supplied by portal vein system rather than hepatic artery system. Thus, transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) might not derive significant benefits. On the other hand, this case progressed dramatically after showing resistance to EGFR-TKIs. In this case, switching to chemotherapy is suggested according to what IMPRESS trial indicated [12]. Considering the previous evidence of the patients’ insensitivity to pemetrexed, we decided to use gemcitabine single agent chemotherapy.

Recent advances in non-invasive rebiopsy approaches such as multiplex genomic profiling of ctDNA provided us an alternative [13]. We decided to obtain peripheral blood from this patient to perform a NSCLC-related multiplex genotyping, in order to clarify the resistance mechanism. Surprisingly, in addition to the 19del EGFR mutation that was previously discovered in the primary lesion, EML4-ALK fusion with relatively high abundance in plasma was detected. Given that the extra-hepatic lesions were all under control, indicating their lasting response to HY-15772 API, we added Crizotinib, the only approved agent to inhibit ALK-driving tumors, to the regimen without withdrawing the EGFR suppressor. Previous reports suggested no significant superimposed toxicity in dual treatment with EGFR and ALK inhibitors [14]. In this case, the patient presented rapid relief without any grade III adverse events. Undoutedly, the timely addition of ALK inhibitors salvaged the patient as previous gemcitabine showed no efficacy.\\n\\nThough some previous studies reported co-existence of EGFR and ALK in the same lesions, this is the first report showing ALK rearragement in distant metastatic lesions in a patient potentially harboring pure EGFR mutations in the primary lesion. Since rebiopsy for the liver metastases in the left lobe was not an option in this case, we had no direct evidence that the liver progression was driven by ALK fusion. However, the great abundance of EML4-ALK fusion signals in the plasma upon disease progression and the significant response after adding crizotinib (as well as the AP26113 API after resistance to crizotinib) strongly supported the existence of ALK fusion in the growing liver metastases. In addition, it was not likely that the primary lesion harbored concurrent EGFR mutation and ALK fusion because both routine ARMS and NGS re-analysis showed that no ALK fusion was detected and the pulmonary lesions were all in good control by HY-15772 API when the hepatic metastases progressed. Such heterogeneity might be more common than we have previously acknowledged, and might have a great impact on treatment strategy. In the past, we could only detect genetic alterations with site by site tissue samples. It was too difficult to obtain tissues from all lesions; multiplex genotyping with ctDNA might help address this issue. Thus, with the current technology, we should reevaluate the heterogeneity across different lesions and their incidence. Of course, the sensitivity of ctDNA examination and the substantial validation require further efforts.'], hint: None\n",

We detected elevated levels of inflammatory makers and PR3-anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA). Subsequently, the muscle weakness rapidly progressed to an MMT of 2 for all limbs. Magnetic resonance imaging indicated muscle edema, and the creatine kinase (CK) level increased to 29,998 U/L. Methylprednisolone (mPSL) and cyclophosphamide pulse therapy improved the patient symptoms. MMT recovered to 4 for all limbs.

A final diagnosis of microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) limited to the muscles was made.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nSystemic vasculitis usually affects multiple organ systems. Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a common cause of systemic vasculitis (1). The disease frequently affects the lungs, kidneys, and nervous and cutaneous systems. In contrast to systemic vasculitis, vasculitis limited to single organs has also been identified (2). For example, renal- and pulmonary-limited types are considered mild forms of AAV (2, 3). In addition to these major target organs, other organs can occasionally be affected. For example, otitis media with AAV (OMAAV) is considered a part of limited organ-type vasculitis (4). Hepatic aneurysm is another a rare presentation of AAV (5-8), and retinal, breast, and urogenital structures can also become target organs on occasion (9). In addition, muscles can also become a target organ of vasculitis (10-12). Previous reports have shown that the lower limbs are primarily affected in vasculitis.\\n\\nWe herein report an unusual case of vasculitis that affects all limbs.\\n\\nCase Report\\nA 58-year-old Japanese man was referred to our hospital for muscle pain and weakness. Two weeks before admission, the patient noticed left-knee pain. A prior physician diagnosed the patient as gout arthritis, given that the patient had a history of several previous gout attacks.\\n\\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, vitamin B12, and allopurinol were administered. One week before admission, the patient experienced worsening pain in his limbs and was unable to stand up alone. The patient was then brought to the hospital. He had been healthy before this episode, except for having gout arthritis. He took no medications except for a prior prescription from his physician. He was a current smoker (40 packs over 40 years) and drank 1-2 L of beer daily. He had no history of traveling abroad or contact with animals during the last year.'], hint: None\n",

Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\nRAP is a rare complication of transradial access (TRA) and can occur as a sequela of arterial wall trauma and inadequate hemostasis after TRI. According Lemaitre J et al only 22 cases of RAP have been reported in world literature until 2006 1. In a recent publication only five cases of RAP were detected after 16,808 TRA (3 out of 10,000 catheterizations, 0,03%) 2, which is significantly lower compared to frequency of femoral pseudoaneurysm (0.6%) complicating femoral access 3. The prevalence of RAP may increase in the future due to growing popularity of TRI.\\n\\nTreatment of RAPs has evolved through the years. Initially surgical treatment was the dominant form of management for RAP. Subsequently, many cases have been treated with ultrasound‐guided mechanical compression. Recently, thrombin injection under ultrasound guidance has become the preferred treatment method.\\n\\nWe describe a novel technique for treatment of RAP using ipsilateral radial artery catheterization with long introducer sheath placement and gentle mechanical compression isolating the pseudoaneurysm with resultant cessation of flow in the sac, thrombosis and subsequent closure.\\n\\nCASE PRESENTATION\\nA 68‐year‐old man with previous posterior MI, persistent atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and moderately depressed left ventricular function (EF\\u2009=\\u20090,44) was admitted with life‐style limiting CCS class III angina. Diagnostic coronary angiography and possible PCI was planned using radial access. He underwent cardiac catheterization from the right radial using a 16 cm 6F hydrophilic introducer sheath (Terumo Interventional Systems, Japan). The radial artery had an anomalous origin from the mid‐segment of brachial artery. Coronary stenoses were identified in the right coronary artery (RCA) and PCI was planned as a second stage in 2–3 weeks. At the time of diagnostic examination patient was on warfarin therapy and additional clopidogrel was prescribed for the forthcoming PCI procedure. The International Normalized Ratio (INR) at the time of angiography was 1.09. The sheath was removed and hemostasis was achieved using TR band (Terumo Interventional Systems, Japan).

A systolic bruit was audible over the mass and duplex ultrasonography demonstrated an oval‐shape dual chamber pseudoaneurysm measuring 49 X 38 mm, partially filled with thrombus. Pseudoaneurysm sac was connected to the radial artery lumen through a long (6 mm) and narrow (2 mm in diameter) neck (Fig. 2). Radial artery was patent and INR at the time of repeat hospitalization was 1.57.\\n\\nFigure 1 Pulsatile swelling at the right wrist just proximal to the previous puncture point of radial artery (arrow).\\n\\nFigure 2 Duplex ultrasonography demonstrated dual chamber (arrowheads) pseudoaneurysm of radial artery (RA) with turbulent blood flow and narrow neck connection (arrow) with RA lumen. Pseudoaneurysm sac was partially filled with thrombotic mass.\\n\\nAt this point we contemplated a combined strategy of PCI of RCA and repair of RAP.\\n\\nWe decided to use the affected radial artery as the access site for PCI, because ultrasonography indicated presence of sufficient length and diameter of intact artery distal to RAP for puncture and catheterization. After successful puncture of radial artery distal to RAP, a small vessel dilator (5F) was inserted into RA lumen and retrograde radial artery angiography was performed using low pressure manual contrast injection. Radial artery angiography confirmed RA patency and significant deviation of its anatomic course at the site of RAP was seen with the signs of RA lumen narrowing as a result of extrinsic RA compression (Fig. 3a). Pseudoaneurysm was visualized with turbulent blood flow into aneurysm sac with QCA measured dimensions of 38.7 X 36.8 mm.

Over time, arterial blood flow under high pressure creates a cavity outlined by inflammatory cells and fibroblasts subsequently replaced by fibrous tissue and the inner surface covered by endothelium.\\n\\nDevelopment of femoral artery pseudoaneurysm (FAP) is described well in literature with a reported incidence of 0.2% for diagnostic and 0.8% for interventional transfemoral procedures 4, 5. In contrast, the real world incidence of radial artery pseudoaneurysm (RAP) is unknown, probably because of lower incidence and underreporting.

However, large pseudoaneurysms which do not thrombose spontaneously, should be treated, because potential complications of RAP may be nearby venous compression, thromboembolism and rupture with significant bleeding requiring urgent surgery 6, 7. Until recently, the standard technique of treatment has been surgical repair including radial artery ligation, patch angioplasty using vein segment, RAP ligation and excision with end‐to‐end anastomosis 8, 9, 10. During the past decade several minimally invasive methods have been introduced that have largely replaced surgical treatment. Most common techniques are ultrasound‐guided compression 2, 11, 12 and percutaneous thrombin injection into RAP sac under ultrasound guidance 2, 13, 14.\\n\\nUltrasonographically guided compression is associated with a high success rate 11, 12, but this technique also has significant limitations, including decreased success rate for patients taking long‐term anticoagulation therapy 11, 15 and prolonged compression time, often resulting in patient discomfort and pain. Sometimes there are recurrences after compression therapy subsequently requiring further compression attempts or surgery 16. Moreover, pseudoaneurysm with relatively rigid fibrous wall require prolonged forceful compression that may cause occlusion of small caliber radial arteries, despite use ultrasound guidance, as cessation of radial artery flow during compression has been identified a risk factor for subsequent radial artery occlusion (RAO) 17, as well as prolonged compression of the artery 18.\\n\\nUltrasound‐guided thrombin injection is a quick and more effective technique in almost all cases even in patients with anticoagulation therapy. However, direct thrombin injection into pseudoaneurysm sac is not without risk. The unattended escape of thrombin into adjacent main artery can result in thromboembolism to the distal arterial bed, resulting in necrosis 19. In recent publication Zegri et al described a case of asymptomatic RAO after thrombin injection in RAP sac2. Teh et al described a case of thrombin injection into temporal artery pseudoaneurysm with unexpected outcome of seizure and scalp necrosis 6. In another publication D'Achille et al presented a case where thrombin injection in RAP sac led to distal skin changes suggesting distal vessel embolization after possible thrombin entry in arterial circulation 20.

The stasis of blood in RAP sac facilitates thrombosis of the sac and resolution of pseudoaneurysm, without the need of external compression. Moreover, if needed we can safely inject thrombin into RAP sac after covering RAP neck by the sheath without the risk of thrombin entry into the arterial circulation.\\n\\nInitial angiography demonstrated significant deviation and stenosis of RA at the site of RAP and solely mechanical compression even ultrasound guidance did not guarantee radial artery patency and sheath was protected arterial lumen against external mechanical compression. In general, arterial sheath acts as a temporary covered stent, which can be removed after successful closure of RAP. Permanent covered stents has been utilized with good results in treatment of pseudoaneurysms of large caliber arteries 22, but in radial artery with mean diameter less than 2.5 mm, use of permanent covered stents may be risky. For prevention of radial artery closure after long dwell time of the arterial sheath, patent hemostasis technique should be used after sheath removal to prevent RAO 23.\\n\\nPossible contributing cause of RAP formation in our case was inadequate index hemostasis with an adverse influence of long‐term systemic anticoagulation therapy, which likely facilitated persistent communication between main artery and pseudoaneurysm sac. Earlier, Collins et al. noted that full anticoagulation therapy, rather than inadequate compression, was a potential contributing factor for development of RAP 8. While radial artery access is favored in such high risk patients to avoid bleeding complications, ongoing anticoagulation therapy may predispose to RAP formation. Prolonged non‐occlusive hemostatic compression, as well as other measures such as, use of smaller diameter introducer sheath, temporary interruption of anticoagulation therapy and surveillance for RAP (palpation of radial puncture site, ultrasound examination) during follow‐up after TRI procedure, may lower the incidence and aid in early detection of RAP.\\n\\nDespite the success of temporary radial artery occluding technique with arterial sheath for nonsurgical RAP treatment some questions remain and require further investigation, such as optimal sheath/radial artery diameter ratio, appropriate sheath dwell time in the artery for reliable RAP closure and monitoring after successful RAP closure.\\n\\nCONCLUSION'], hint: None\n",

In the 1980s, Pneumocystis rRNA and mitochondrial DNA had been analyzed, by which this organism was identified as a fungus1). P. jirovecii belongs to the genus of Pneumocystis and is a human specific pathogen2). Serologic surveys show that most humans are infected by 2–3 years old3). In the immunocompetent children, these infections are usually asymptomatic. However, P. jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) usually occurs in severely immunocompromised hosts34). Prematurity, malnutrition in infants, immunosuppressive treatment, transplantation, primary immunodeficiency disorders and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are well-known risk factors for PCP5). PCP in immunocompromised persons can be a life threatening infection. It has been reported that up to 43% of children with cancer developed PCP before the era of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) prophylaxis and nowadays its occurrence is much less with prophylaxis3). However, certain immunocompromised patients still develop PCP56).

PCP was confirmed by direct fluorescent antibody from bronchial washing fluid or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in patients who were suspected to have PCP with pertinent clinical manifestation. The Institutional Review Board of Samsung Medical Center approved this study (approval number: 2015-02-067).\\n\\nResults\\nFifteen episodes of PCP were diagnosed in 14 patients. Among them 1 patient with severe aplastic anemia developed PCP twice at the age of 6 years and 16 years old.\\n\\nMedian age of the first PCP episode was 8.3 years (range, 0.4–18.6 years). Among these 14 patients, 10 patients (71.4%) had hematology-oncology diseases and two had primary immunodeficiency disorders (severe combined immunodeficiency and Wiskott Aldrich syndrome).

He also had coinfection with Acinetobacter baumanii pneumonia. The second patient was diagnosed with PCP twice in 2004 and 2014, respectively. He did not receive any prophylaxis before both episodes of PCP. The patient was recovered from the first episode of PCP after TMP/SMX and pentamidine combination therapy with steroid. Ten years later, he developed the second episode of PCP and was treated with TMP/SMX and caspofungin combination therapy with steroid. However, during this 2nd episode, the patient also had probable invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) and died of progressing respiratory failure. The third patient developed PCP 104 days after the 2nd allogeneic HCT despite prophylaxis. Unfortunately, he also had bacteremia due to vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE). He was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for VRE bacteremia and also for PCP but died. The forth patient was an infant with neuroblastoma. The patient was not receiving PCP prophylaxis according to the protocol. She developed persistent tachypnea with low oxygen saturation for which PCP was suspected later and she received empiric treatment for PCP with TMP/SMX. She received TMP/SMX and pentamidine combination therapy with steroid. However, her condition became deteriorated and she died 28 days after PCP confirmation from the lung tissue.

Secondly, there was 1 patient who developed PCP before the engraftment after HCT and did not have a chance to start PCP prophylaxis. Thirdly, there was one patient who developed PCP after the termination of recommended PCP prophylaxis period. Fourthly, in cases of primary immunodeficiency disorders, the 2 patients presented with PCP as one of the initial manifestations before being diagnosed with primary immunodeficiency disorders. Finally, there were patients who started PCP prophylaxis but stopped transiently with any reason, and did not resume prophylaxis properly even though the risk still existed.\\n\\nIt has been reported that non-HIV immunocompromised patients had more acute respiratory symptoms and needed more mechanical ventilator support than with those with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome7). Severe respiratory failure patients who needed the mechanical ventilator increased mortality rate up to 60% to 75%. Steroid is frequently used in PCP cases. However, unlike HIV patients in whom steroid use appeared beneficial8), there have been conflicting reports on steroid use in non-HIV patients with PCP9). Nine (9 of 15, 60%) of our patients also received steroid and all of the patients who needed ICU cared received steroid. Among the 9 patients treated with steroid, 3 patients (33.3%) died.

In this study, 1 patient developed 2 episodes of PCP. For the first episode, he received TMP/SMX and pentamidine combination therapy with steroid and successfully recovered from the infection. For the second episode, he received TMP/SMX and caspofungin combination therapy with steroid but failed to recover from the infection and died of respiratory failure aggravation. It is not clear whether caspofungin was not efficacious in treating PCP in this patient because he also had IPA.

We report a case of lung cancer with CLC that caused both superior vena cava (SVC) stenosis and cervicofacial oedema, suggestive of SVC syndrome. A 64-year-old woman with lung adenocarcinoma presented with cervicofacial oedema and erythema, followed by severe dyspnoea 2 months after four cycles of carboplatin, pemetrexed and bevacizumab triplet therapy. Although chest CT indicated SVC stenosis, cervicofacial oedema remained despite treating the SVC stenosis via balloon dilation. A skin biopsy of the erythematic sample confirmed CLC as the cause of the patient's symptoms. CLC should be considered as a differential diagnosis of cervicofacial oedema in addition to SVC syndrome, especially when it is observed in combination with skin erythema and induration. Moreover, a skin biopsy should be performed promptly for accurate diagnosis of CLC and to decide on appropriate treatment.\\n\\nBackground\\nWhen lung cancer progression causes symptoms that reduce the ability to manage daily activities, adequate symptom treatment is required. Superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome is a major complication of lung cancer that occurs when the lung tumour compresses the SVC extrinsically, which causes cervicofacial oedema and dyspnoea.1 Among treatment options for SVC syndrome, an indwelling SVC stent effectively improves symptoms within a few days.1 Cutaneous lymphangitis carcinomatosa (CLC), a rare condition that accounts for less than 5% of cutaneous metastases, also causes cervicofacial oedema,2 and patients with CLC usually present with progressive lymphoedema and erythema.3 Here, we report a rare case of lung adenocarcinoma with CLC and SVC stenosis in a patient whose cervicofacial oedema and dyspnoea remained despite improving SVC blood flow via balloon dilation.\\n\\nCase presentation\\nA 64-year-old woman with a 20-pack-year smoking history presented with a persistent cough for 3 months.

This disease course is typical of SVC syndrome, which was the main cause of the symptoms. SVC syndrome arises from the compression of thin-walled SVC by enlarged paratracheal lymph nodes, mostly caused by lung cancer.1 The common symptoms of SVC syndrome include neck swelling, dyspnoea, facial swelling, cough and dilated chest collateral veins.1 Contrast-enhanced CT may elucidate the cause and extent of venous obstruction in SVC syndrome. The initial treatment in emergent cases of SVC syndrome is endovascular stenting of the SVC to restore flow. SVC stenting is reported to improve symptoms of SVC syndrome within 1–3 days, and recurrence rarely occurs.1 In the present case, SVC blood flow remained despite its prominent stenosis, and symptoms improved for only a few hours. The rapid recurrence of symptoms is atypical for SVC syndrome and indicates that there were other causes that made the patient’s symptoms more intractable.\\n\\nIn the present case, the patient presented with induration of the chest and abdomen, and a prompt skin biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of CLC. CLC is a rare form of skin metastases that exhibits extensive dermal and subcutaneous lymphatic invasion. This subcutaneous lymphatic invasion results in lymphoedema and diffuse skin erythema mimicking an infectious process, which differs from the typical form of cutaneous metastases such as nodules or masses.3–6 The incidences of cutaneous metastases in patients with metastatic cancer and with lung cancer are approximately 5% and 1.7%–3.1%, respectively; CLC accounts for approximately 5% of all cutaneous metastases.2 7 The most common histological feature observed in patients with lung cancer who develop CLC is adenocarcinoma, as in the present case.8 Cutaneous metastasis in lung cancer tends to occur in order in the anterior chest wall, back and abdomen.7 9–11 Cutaneous metastases are considered a late event in the evolution of the majority of malignancies.9 Lung cancer is the quickest to metastasise to the skin (15.75 months) among solid tumours.3 The average survival time from the appearance of CLC in lung cancer (less than 3 months) is shorter than that from the appearance of cutaneous metastasis (3 to 5 months).3 7 12 The only known treatment for CLC is systemic chemotherapy, but early diagnosis can lead to earlier anticancer treatment.8 Osimertinib may improve the prognosis of the patients harbouring the EGFR T790M mutation; however, osimertinib was not available for treatment at the time of this diagnosis.13–15 Supportive care for lymphoedema due to CLC, as follows, can improve patients’ quality of life and may even influence the progression of the disease: manual lymph drainage, compression therapy with bandages or special stockings, dermatological skin\\xa0care and psychological treatment.3'], hint: None\n",

Since then, only a few hundred cases have been reported. It was reported mostly in Asian patients as sporadic case reports and small case series [2]. Colorectal SRCC is very rare, comprising less than 1% of colorectal cancer (CRC) cases [3]. SRCC and mucinous adenocarcinoma (MAC) with signet cells are two overlapping entities. SRCC can occur within the pools of MAC or in a diffusely infiltrative process with minimal extracellular mucin in a linitis plastica [4]. On the other hand, the World Health Organization (WHO) defined MAC as a carcinoma confirmed by > 50% of extracellular mucin pools that contain malignant epithelial or individual tumor cells including SRCC [4]. SRCC mainly occurs on the right side of the colon [5]. The main differential diagnosis is metastatic gastric carcinoma with SRCC, and it is necessary to rule out this diagnosis by endoscopy before finalizing a diagnosis of primary colorectal SRCC. SRCC is associated with poor prognosis. Despite the rarity of SRCC, it is more frequently associated with patients with ulcerative colitis [6].

In the USA, annually, approximately 145,600 new cases of large bowel cancer are diagnosed, of which 101,420 are colon and the remainder are rectal cancers [7]. Annually, approximately 50,630 Americans die of CRC, accounting for approximately 8% of all cancer deaths [6]. More than 90% of CRC cases are adenocarcinomas [8]; however, several histological variants have been distinguished such as mucinous, signet ring cell, medullary, adenosquamous, micropapillary, spindle cell and undifferentiated [8]. Signet cell carcinoma is a subtype of colon cancer. The name SRCC is a descriptive term describing a carcinoma cell retaining abundant intracytoplasmic mucin that causes the nucleus to be pushed to the periphery of the cell. In affected sites, the tumor infiltrates the entire wall, therefore results in a rigid and contracted structure called the linitis plastica [5]. The majority of these tumors arise in the stomach. However, it was also described in breast, lung, bladder, pancreas, gallbladder and the colon. It is a rare tumor comprising less than 1% of all CRC cases [2]. SRCC is predominant in males with a ratio of 2:1. Belli et al reported the most common location is the right side of the colon [9]. Our patient is a young man and had the tumor on the transverse colon. These tumors can be classified into either MAC with signet cell (a subtype of MAC) or SRCC. WHO definition of SRCC is carcinoma confirmed by > 50% of SRCC but states that SRCC can occur within the pools of MAC or in a diffusely infiltrative process with minimal extracellular mucin in a linitis plastica pattern [9]. Luis et al described in his retrospective study that 68.7% of SRCC cases occur in the right colon, 9.4% in the transverse and 21.9% in the left colon [5]. Our patient had the tumor on the transverse colon. Of the patients, 43.7% present with metastasis, whereas 64.3% of cases metastasize to the peritoneum, 46.5% present with lymph node metastasis (LNM) (mean of 14.3 positive lymph nodes), 62.5% with lymphovascular invasion and 25% with perineural invasion [5]. However, in the same study when SRCC was compared to MAC with signet cell, SRCC showed some distinctive characteristics. Patients presented a decade later (65 versus 56.5 years in comparison to MAC) as well as, in a higher clinical stage [5].\\n\\nThe pathogenesis of colorectal SRCC has not been fully understood yet. Tendon et al reported adenoma to carcinoma sequence for colorectal SRCC [10]. However, it is believed that SRCC may have a different mode of pathogenesis [11]. Hartman et al reported that precursor adenomatous lesions were more frequently observed in mucin-rich SRCC, and not in mucin-poor SRCCs [12]. There is an association between ulcerative colitis and SRCC. Colitis-associated carcinogenesis (CAC) leads to development of cancer through a different carcinogenic pathway known as the inflammation-metaplasia-dysplasia-carcinoma sequence with earlier identified molecular changes in TP531 [6].'], hint: None\n",

Together they represent about 30% of tumors with these genetic features [12]. The impact of MSI on survival in colorectal SRCC has not been confirmed to have a prognostic value on survival [12]. It is most likely due to small size of previous studies. Further research is required to confirm or reject this hypothesis [13]. In our patient DNA mismatch repair (MMR) protein analysis was performed. Analyses for MLH-1, MSH-2, MSH-6 and PMS2 were all normal. Mutations in the ras gene family (K-ras, H-ras and N-ras) are found in about 50% of CRCs. Ninety-five percent of ras mutations are identified at k-ras gene, with 80% at codon 12 and 15% at codon 13 [13]. There are limited data in the literature on ras gene mutations in colorectal SRCC.\\n\\nColitis-associated signet cell carcinoma in situ is associated with alterations of TP53 and CDH1 genes, resulting in a low expression of E-cadherin protein which impairs cell-cell adherence junctions and cell-proliferation signaling pathways.

It binds to CD 20 receptors on B cells, leading to the destruction of B cells including both the normal and cancerous cells [1]. It is especially used to treat diseases which have a high number of B cells or are characterized by abnormal B cells. By eliminating abnormal B cells, it allows the body to make normal and healthy B cells.\\xa0Normal B cells are rapidly depleted from the peripheral blood and remain depleted until nearly six months post-treatment, followed by a slow recovery [2].

After 11 months of complete remission (CR) following UCBT, the bone marrow showed 7.5% myeloblasts. CR was obtained after a single course of azacitidine monotherapy, but the myeloblasts gradually increased in the blood. We made a diagnosis of acute megakaryoblastic leukemia derived from donor cell with a fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of the sex chromosomes and an immunophenotypic analysis. Azacitidine was administered again and produced a therapeutic effect of stable disease. This case suggests that azacitidine may be a useful therapy for patients with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia in situations in which intensive chemotherapy and transplantation are not indicated.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nAcute megakaryoblastic leukemia has been described as a subtype of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) (1) and was incorporated into the French-American-British (FAB) classification of AML as M7 (2).

Histopathologic evidence of M7 AML itself is an independent poor prognostic factor for the overall survival (3).\\n\\nAzacitidine, a demethylation agent, has demonstrated a significant survival benefit in patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) relative to conventional care and has also been proved effective in older patients with newly diagnosed AML with >30% blasts (4,5).

After L-ASP monotherapy, we re-examined the surface markers of the leukemic cells by FCM, which showed positivity for CD41, as well as CD7, CD21, CD33, CD34, CD38, CD56 and HLA-DR (Fig. 3).

Table 3 shows the main characteristics of the original leukemia and donor cell leukemia in our report. HSCT is an effective treatment for many hematologic malignancies, but disease relapse remains a major cause of post-transplant mortality (6). DCL is de novo leukemia developing in donor-derived hematopoietic precursor cells and is a rare but severe complication after allogeneic HSCT. The incidence of DCL may have been underestimated because clinicians do not perform thorough examinations to distinguish between recipient-derived cells and donor-derived cells in cases of leukemia developing after HSCT. DCL has become well known, and a number of reports of DCL have been published in recent years (7-9). It is important to distinguish DCL from relapse of original diseases when patients develop leukemia mimicking the original diseases after allogeneic HSCT, especially in cases where a decision regarding treatment for the leukemia must be made.\\n\\nTable 3.

Shiozaki et al. reported that the characteristics of DCL occurring after UCBT were different from those occurring after bone marrow transplantation (BMT), including the duration of time between transplantation and the occurrence of DCL, and the types of abnormal karyotypes (11). DCL occurred within a significantly shorter period after UCBT than after BMT, with a median duration of 14.5 months for UCBT and 36 months for BMT. The frequency of monosomy 7 observed in DCL after UCBT was significantly higher than that in DCL after BMT. Greaves reported that up to 5% of CB samples might harbor potentially pre-leukemic clones, raising the possibility that DCL might be disproportionately common after UCBT (12). It has been reported that risk factors for DCL include the use of cells obtained from elderly donors and cells obtained from cord blood (13).

In the present N\\xa0=\\xa01 case we retrospectively have analysed lymphoma tissue by exome sequencing and global gene expression in a patient with unexpected long-term remission following relaps. The goals were to phenotype the diagnostic and relapsed lymphoma tissue and evaluate its pattern. Furthermore, to identify mutations available for targeted therapy and expression of genes to predict specific drug effects by resistance gene signatures (REGS) for R-CHOP as described at http://www.hemaclass.org. We expected that such a study could generate therapeutic information and a frame for future individual evaluation of molecular resistance detected at clinical relapse.\\n\\n\\nMETHODS\\nThe patient was diagnosed with a transformed high-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma stage III and treated with conventional R-CHOP [rituximab (R), cyclophosphamide (C), doxorubicin (H), vincristine (O) and prednisone (P)]. Unfortunately, she suffered from severe toxicity but recovered during the following 6 months\\' remission until biopsy-verified relapse. The patient refused second-line combination chemotherapy, but accepted 3 months\\' palliation with R and chlorambucil. Unexpectedly, she obtained continuous complete remission and is at present\\xa0>9\\xa0years after primary diagnosis. Molecular studies and data evaluation by principal component analysis, mutation screening and copy number variations of the primary and relapsed tumor, identified a pattern of branched lymphoma evolution, most likely diverging from an in situ follicular lymphoma. Accordingly, the primary diagnosed transformed lymphoma was classified as a diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) of the GCB/centrocytic subtype by \"cell of origin BAGS\" assignment and R sensitive and C, H, O and P resistant by \"drug specific REGS\" assignment. The relapsed DLBCL was classified as NC/memory subtype and R, C, H sensitive but O and P resistant.\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nThorough analysis of the tumor DNA and RNA documented a branched evolution of the two clinical diagnosed tFL, most likely transformed from an unknown in situ lymphoma. Classification of the malignant tissue for drug-specific resistance did not explain the unexpected long-term remission and potential cure.

It can evolve into the more aggressive histology of transformed FL (tFL) [3], resembling diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), but share a distinct gene expression profile and immunophenotype with the primary FL [4–8]. This transformation occurs by the expansion of one or more subclones with loss of the follicular growth pattern resulting in a rapidly progressive clinical course refractory to treatment and with inferior prognosis. To distinguish between progression and transformation of FL a biopsy for histological examination is needed in case of symptoms and CT verified tumor progression. The histological verified presence of both follicular and diffuse architecture in the initial diagnostic biopsy represents a finding that implies early transformation of FL [2, 3]. The survival post-transformation ranges between median 7–20\\xa0months [9, 10].\\n\\nSimilar to progression, the transformation is a clonal evolution from an ancestral clone that initially arises from a common normal cell of origin (COO) through linear or branched outgrowth of an existing subclone, deregulated by random genetic or epigenetic hits.\\n\\nOur knowledge of genetic aberrations in FL has dramatically increased over the last few years, and recent comprehensive studies by exome sequencing has identified the mutational landscape and the genetic changes that contribute to the step wise tumor progression, including transformation to DLBCL [4–8, 11–18].\\n\\nHere we report a unique, biopsy and histology verified case of primary tFL with relapse and long-term remission following palliation therapy. As molecular studies of such unexpected outcome may be informative, we decided to study the two malignant tissue biopsies and a germ line DNA sample to thorough analysis with the aim to identify differences in an attempt to understand and explain the clinical outcome.\\n\\nThe case will also illustrate the molecular technologies, knowledge and competences that are increasingly available to challenge the “one size fits all” approach to early clinical phase I–II drug trials in relapsed patients and replace this with a predictive strategy. We envisage that therapies will be stratified to reflect disease heterogeneity, in a departure from the current use of non-precise chemotherapeutic agents and allow for the development of new taxonomy and companion diagnostics—a clear need in future clinical care.\\n\\nCase presentation'], hint: None\n",

Use of compounds containing 5-aminosalicylic acid is an area of controversy because of the HPS platelet storage pool defect [1]. In fact, our patient is now in sustained clinical remission with colonic mucosal healing using only IFX.\\n\\nPatients with a diverse spectrum of rare genetic disorders can present with IBD, a situation referred to as monogenic IBD [4, 8, 9].

Genetic screening using next-generation sequencing is a highly useful approach to diagnosis of patients with monogenic IBD [4, 8, 9].

There are several potential reasons for this phenomenon. Firstly, the survival of EGFR+ NSCLC patients has been significantly prolonged.6 Secondly, first (i.e. gefitinib) and second‐generation (afatinib) EGFR‐TKIs have poor penetration across the blood–brain barrier (BBB).

As in this patient, the presenting complaint was diarrhoea, which was actually a manifestation rather than a cause for sepsis and clearly had a hidden diagnosis, which could have been missed if the patient was not adequately exposed.\\n\\nDiscussion\\nNecrotising fasciitis was first been described in soldiers during the American Civil war in the eighteenth century. This condition has been known by various names including phagadena gangrenosum, Meleney’s gangrene, Fournier’s gangrene (necrotising fasciitis of the perineum). The term necrotising fasciitis was first coined in 1952 by American Surgeon B Wilson.\\n\\nNecrotising fasciitis is classified into three types based on the organisms involved. Type I is polymicrobial, type II is monomicrobial and type III by a specific pathogen namely marine Vibrio species (V. vulnificus). Bacteria associated with type I are a combination of gram-positive cocci (streptococci and staphylococci), gram-negative species (Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas and Klebsiella) and anaerobic organisms like Bacteroides and Clostridia [1].\\n\\nNF is a rapidly progressing bacterial infection involving the subcutaneous tissues. The bacteria produce endotoxin and exotoxin [2] that leads to micro-vascular thrombosis [3], tissue ischaemia and liquefactive necrosis. This causes a systemic illness [4] often progressing to septic shock, multi-organ dysfunction and death. The condition is resistant to antimicrobial therapy due to poor drug penetration, hence leaving surgical debridement as the primary treatment option [5].'], hint: None\n",

Of these, type 2 diabetes is the commonest underlying medical condition and multiple needle punctures in IV drug users is the commonest trauma predisposing to NF [6].\\n\\nThe clinical picture and presentation of the patient may vary and hence can pose a diagnostic challenge at an early stage and hence requires a very high index of suspicion.

In previously described cases of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) associated with secondary ITP, treatment has consisted of nephrectomy, splenectomy, and corticosteroids. Here, we describe a case of metastatic RCC presenting with a right ventricular mass and subsequent development of secondary ITP. The clinical course was complicated by recurrent severe thrombocytopenia despite treatment with corticosteroids, rituximab, and thrombopoietin receptor agonists, precluding cancer-directed therapy and anticoagulation. Further study is needed to determine the optimal management strategy for malignancy-associated ITP.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nImmune thrombocytopenia (also referred to as immune thrombocytopenic purpura or ITP) is an autoimmune bleeding disorder characterized by isolated low platelet counts resulting from pathologic immune-mediated mechanisms. It occurs as a result of antibody-mediated targeting of platelet antigens in the setting of normal erythrocyte and leukocyte function without evidence of impaired bone marrow production. ITP is a common cause of thrombocytopenia in both children and adults, with an estimated incidence of 1.9–6.4 per 100,000 children/year and 1.6–3.9 per 100,000 adults/year [1]. Primary ITP is a diagnosis of exclusion, where no disorder or medication associated with thrombocytopenia is identified, whereas secondary ITP refers to thrombocytopenia attributable to an underlying disease or the development of drug-induced thrombocytopenia [2].\\n\\nAlthough secondary ITP is more commonly associated with rheumatologic disorders, infections, and hematologic malignancies, it is also seen in patients with solid tumor malignancies, with the highest reported cases in lung and breast cancers [3]. Approximately 20% of patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) experience some form of a paraneoplastic syndrome; however, secondary ITP associated with RCC is rare [4]. Removal of the primary tumor, corticosteroids, and splenectomy have been used to treat RCC-associated ITP with variable success [3]. Further, clinical data supporting effective therapies for patients with malignancy-associated ITP who are not surgical candidates is lacking. In this report, we describe a challenging case of secondary ITP in a patient with advanced RCC.\\n\\nCase Presentation\\nA 47-year-old female with a past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, depression, and tobacco use presented with chest pain and hemoptysis.

Surgical pathology demonstrated unorganized to early organizing thrombus with prominent clusters of highly atypical cells with enlarged nuclei and atypical mitotic figures. Immunohistochemistry was positive for pancytokeratin, PAX-8, and CD10. Overall, the findings were consistent with a cytologically high-grade, pleomorphic tumor favoring metastatic RCC. Follow-up TTE revealed continued moderate RV systolic dysfunction though significant decrease in the size and mobility of the RV mass. Her postoperative course was complicated by anemia and volume overload. She was transitioned from unfractionated heparin infusion to warfarin and aspirin prior to discharge.\\n\\nAbdominal CT scan obtained as an outpatient revealed a 9.9-cm left renal mass, multiple associated enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes, moderate pericardial effusion, nodular and peripheral wedge-shaped opacities in the lung bases concerning for metastatic disease or pulmonary infarcts, and small right greater than left pleural effusions with pleural thickening concerning for malignant effusions.\\n\\nShe was re-admitted after a syncopal event, and chest CT revealed multiple bilateral pulmonary emboli and a 5.5 × 3.0 cm RV mass with severely reduced RV function.

Further cardiac surgery, vascular surgical intervention, or nephrectomy were determined to be unsafe.

Peripheral blood smear revealed occasional schistocytes; however, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) was felt to be unlikely based on absence of clinical evidence for DIC and a normal fibrinogen level. Given concern for secondary ITP as a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with RCC, dexamethasone 40 mg daily was started for 4 days along with subcutaneous romiplostim (1 μg per kg weekly), a thrombopoietin mimetic used in treating ITP that stimulates bone marrow production of platelets by megakaryocytes [5].\\n\\nShe achieved a partial response with improvement in platelet count to 76 × 109/L after 4 days of dexamethasone and a single romiplostim treatment (Fig. 2).

The development of a Bullous pemphigoid (BP)-like blistering disease, driven by autoantibodies against the hemidesmosomal protein BP180, is a potentially serious irAE whose incidence seems to be increasing. We therefore set out to characterize the clinical and (immuno)histopathological features and treatment responses of cases of BP which developed during or after CI therapy collated in six German tertiary referral centers between 2014 and 2018. We identified twelve cases of BP which emerged during and/or after CI therapy. The time interval between the initiation of CI therapy and the diagnosis of BP was 3-74 weeks (median: 23 weeks). Age at the time of diagnosis of BP varied between 62 and 80 years (median: 76 years). The clinical presentation of the patients was diverse but the severity was relatively mild when compared to that seen in most cases of spontaneous BP. Only four patients met all of the immunopathological criteria recommended in the European guidelines for the diagnosis of BP. Topical corticosteroid treatment was sufficient to achieve disease control in most patients. CI therapy could be continued in 8 out of 12 patients. In summary, our study indicates that cases of BP during or after CI therapy bear several peculiarities distinguishing them from spontaneous BP. Given the diversity of the clinical presentation of CI-induced BP the application of existing diagnostic algorithms developed for spontaneous BP can be utilized to uncover the frequency and features of CI-induced BP and to develop and optimize management algorithms.\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nCheckpoint inhibitors (CIs) constitute a new class of immunomodulatory drugs which block co-inhibitory signals on immune effector cells and result in the generation of potent T-cell mediated immune responses. Among the CIs which are currently licensed are monoclonal antibodies which target the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) or the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) pathway. For example, the first-in-class drug ipilimumab inhibits CTLA-4, nivolumab and pembrolizumab inhibit PD-1, and atezolizumab and durvalumab target the PD-1 ligand PD-L1 (1). The advent of checkpoint inhibitors has revolutionized the treatment of solid cancers. Initially licensed for the treatment of metastatic melanoma, CIs are employed in an ever increasing number of cancer entities, including Merkel cell carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, urothelial bladder cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and Hodgkin’s lymphoma (1).'], hint: None\n",

These inflammatory responses are collectively termed “immune-related adverse events” (irAEs), and include, but are not limited to, dermatitis, colitis, hypophysitis, hepatitis, and nephritis (1). The skin is the most frequently affected organ, with up to 50% of patients receiving CIs developing skin-related irAEs.\\n\\nThe clinical presentation of cutaneous irAEs is remarkably diverse. Commonly presenting with a non-specific maculopapular rash accompanied by pruritus, they may also present with lichenoid, eczematous, granulomatous, lupus-like, or erythema multiforme-like skin changes and/or vitiligo (2).\\n\\nMost intriguingly, there is a growing body of literature which reports the development of the antibody-driven autoimmune disease bullous pemphigoid (BP), the most common disease of the group of pemphigoid diseases, in the context of treatment with immune CI (2–8).\\n\\nThe hallmark of BP is the development of autoimmunity against type XVII collagen (BP180) (9). BP presents clinically with the development of widespread urticarial plaques (pre-bullous phase), which evolve into blisters and erosions (10, 11). However, non-bullous and atypical variants of BP also exist. In these variants, patients exhibit localized blister formation with minimal or absent inflammation of the surrounding skin. Additionally, BP may present with predominantly eczematous (including dyshidrosiform) and subacute prurigo-like skin changes (12). Indeed, BP may exist in the absence of skin changes, with the only symptom being widespread, intractable itch. Given the wide spectrum of clinical symptoms and signs in BP, the disease can neither be reliably diagnosed nor excluded based on the clinical presentation alone. The European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) guidelines recommend that the diagnosis of BP should be based on both the clinical findings and (immuno)pathological investigations of the patient’s skin, both lesional and perilesional, and serum (12). Central to establishing the diagnosis of BP is the demonstration of linear depositions of autoantibodies, which are in most cases predominantly of the IgG immunoglobulin class, and/or of complement factor 3 (C3) at the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ) of perilesional skin (12). As the deposition of autoantibodies and/or complement at the DEJ is the defining feature of all pemphigoid diseases and as the clinical features of BP may overlap with those of other pemphigoid diseases, the clear distinction of pemphigoid diseases requires the detection of autoantibodies in the serum and a determination of their antigen specificity. This is achieved by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy on NaCl-split human skin, which detects the presence of autoantibodies against proteins of the dermal-epidermal junction, and by ELISA biochip-based techniques, and/or immunoblot assays to pinpoint th'], hint: None\n",

Serological examination alone is not sufficient to diagnose BP given that autoantibodies are reportedly undetectable in the serum of up to 20% of BP patients, but are present in the serum of 0.5% of healthy individuals (12, 13). Histopathologically, an early blister exhibits a subepidermal cleft combined with a dense dermal inflammatory infiltrate mainly consisting of eosinophils and neutrophils. However, the histopathological examination is also non-specific and is therefore not suitable alone to confirm the diagnosis (14).\\n\\nThe complexity and heterogeneity of both BP and cutaneous irAEs means that a comprehensive clinical, serological, and (immuno)histopathological work-up is central to correctly diagnosing suspected cases of BP during or after CI therapy.

HCQ retinopathy can accompany other retinal complications such as cystoid macular edema (CME) and epiretinal membrane [1]. Specifically, CME is the result of fluid accumulation in the outer plexiform layer in the macular area and leads to central visual loss.\\n\\nSeveral treatment modalities have been shown to be effective for CME combined with other retinal diseases. In eyes with combined CME and retinitis pigmentosa, treatment with oral or topical acetazolamide can produce successful resolution of CME and functional improvement according to previous studies [2–7]. Although the pathogenic mechanism of CME in HCQ retinopathy has not been elucidated, oral or topical acetazolamide may also be useful in the treatment of CME in HCQ retinopathy. Here, we report a case of CME in HCQ retinopathy that improved with the use of oral acetazolamide. Using multimodal imaging modalities, we explored the detailed retinal structural changes, and discussed the possible mechanisms of CME in HCQ retinopathy.\\n\\nCase presentation'], hint: None\n",

The patient had first come to our clinic 7\\xa0months prior, at which time her best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/30 in both eyes and fundus examination showed bilteral midperipheral retinal degeneration. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) showed defects in the paracentral photoreceptor layers. Consistent with this finding, a visual field test revealed dense paracentral ring scotoma with decreased foveal sensitivity in both eyes (Fig. 1). The patient reported no family history of eye diseases and no visual symptoms before the initiation of HCQ therapy, and she had no auditory symptoms. At that time, the patient was diagnosed with HCQ-induced retinal toxicity, HCQ retinopathy, and HCQ treatment was discontinued. Four months later, BCVA was maintained as 20/30 in both eyes.Fig. 1 Diagnosis of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy based on visual field examination, optical coherence tomography, and fundus autofluorescence. a Humphrey 30-2 visual field test shows dense paracentral ring scotoma with decreased foveal sensitivity in both eyes. b Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) demonstrates defects in the paracentral photoreceptor layer. c Fundus autofluorescence reveals decreased paracentral and mid-peripheral fluorescence in both eyes\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDuring the patient’s visit of visual complaint, slit lamp examination showed no specific findings and there was no inflammation in the anterior chamber or vitreous cavity; however, her BCVA had declined to 20/50.

CMT was decreased from 245 to 177\\xa0μm and from 335 to 146\\xa0μm in the right and left eyes, respectively. BCVA was improved to 20/25 in both eyes. Follow-up FA showed decreased dye leakage in both the macular and mid-peripheral areas (Fig. 3).\\n\\nDiscussion\\nHCQ retinopathy presents with initial photoreceptor damage in a classic parafoveal distribution, known as a “bull’s eye” pattern, which corresponds to parafoveal scotomas upon visual field examination [8, 9] and parafoveal thinning of the outer nuclear layer with breakup of the ellipsoid zone and interdigitation zone lines on SD-OCT. [10] However, recent studies have shown that the initial pattern of damage in Asian eyes is more frequently in the more peripheral extramacular area near the arcades, as a pericentral pattern [11, 12]. In this pattern of retinopathy, CME may threaten relatively preserved central vision, leading to deterioration of visual function.\\n\\nCME can develop in various retinal disorders [13]. Macular edema associated with chloroquine (CQ) retinopathy is relatively rare, and it was reported in 5 of 78 patients during a study period from 1957 to 1979 [14]; however, its treatment has not been discussed extensively. Although some cellular and molecular factors have been elucidated, the precise mechanisms for the formation of CME are unknown, including for HCQ retinopathy. In retinitis pigmentosa, CME formation has been suggested to involve breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier (BRB) as a result of chronic, low-grade inflammation [15–21] and decreased fluid transport efficiency of the retinal pigment epithelium [3]. CME associated with HCQ retinopathy has been reported in both leaking [22] and non-leaking [23] forms. In this case, it can be assumed that the leaking form of CME occurred owing to a mechanism such as BRB breakdown due to HCQ damage and that CME developed because such damage was not recovered even after the drug was cut off; however, the precise mechanism should be revealed in future studies.\\n\\nIn the present case, the CME associated with HCQ retinopathy exhibited diffuse leakage on FA that resolved with oral acetazolamide as evidenced by decreased fluorescein leakage. Acetazolamide reduces macular edema and improves visual acuity in some patients with macular edema related to certain inflammatory and degenerative eye diseases, including chronic iridocyclitis and retinitis pigmentosa [4]. With respect to mechanism, acetazolamide has been suggested to stimulate outward active transport and passive permeability across the BRB [6, 24, 25]. More specifically, acetazolamide blocks the active transport of certain ions (HCO3-, Cl-) across the retinal pigment epithelium [26], and also hastens the rate of resorption of subretinal fluid [27]. In our patient, acetazolamide was thought to induce functional recovery of the BRB, leading to a reduction in diffuse leakage and also improvement of CME.'], hint: None\n",

However, the patients in that study also had epiretinal membrane, which may have limited the beneficial effects of acetazolamide on reducing macular edema. Aside from carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, other treatment options for CME with HCQ retinopathy such as triamcinolone or anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibodies have not been described in the literature. In our case, there were no accompanying structural alterations to the central macular area such as epiretinal membrane, which likely explains why acetazolamide was effective for anatomic and functional improvement of CME.\\n\\nRetinitis pigmentosa associated with various types of mutations shows similar features to advanced HCQ retinopathy; therefore, retinitis pigmentosa should be carefully assessed for the differential diagnosis in patients taking HCQ medication. In the present case, the patient reported no family history of eye diseases and no visual symptoms before the initiation of HCQ therapy and she had no auditory symptoms. Genetic analyses on the associated mutations might be helpful for ruling out the possibilities of retinitis pigmentosa; however, we believe that the baseline (at the time of HCQ initiation) full-field electroretinography (ERG) and/or multifocal ERG may be very suggestive for the differential diagnosis.\\n\\nConclusion\\nIn conclusion, this case suggests that oral acetazolamide is an effective treatment for CME associated with HCQ retinopathy.

Ocular pain and a blurred vision appeared after treatment and the patient visited the ophthalmology emergency room, where he was diagnosed with acute anterior uveitis (AAU), synechiae, and bilateral papillitis. The patient was treated with topical corticosteroids, prednisone, and mydriatics, which immediately improved the patient's status. Therefore, when an ocular inflammatory disease exists, immune checkpoint inhibitor treatments must be ruled out as possible causes.\\n\\nPembrolizumab is a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody that is selective against the PD-1 receptor on the cell surface. It is used in the treatment of unresectable metastatic melanomas. The response rate of this treatment is about 40%.[1] Although the frequency of adverse effects is high, in majority of the cases these are mild and easily treated.[23] These side effects are known as immune-related adverse events because they are caused by the lack of inhibition of T lymphocytes.\\n\\nOcular complications appear in less than 1% of the patients and are severe and require early treatment.[1]\\n\\nCase Report\\nA 38-year-old male, Caucasian, diagnosed with a BRAF-mutant melanoma with locoregional recurrence, a satellite nodule, and adenopathies. Treatment with pembrolizumab was initiated.

He had a visual acuity (VA) of 20/20, Tyndall +++ in the right eye (OD) and Tyndall++++ in the left eye (OS) with multiple inferior iridocrystalline synechiae in both eyes (OU) and no hypopyon.

The examination after 24 hours revealed Tyndall++ in OD and Tyndall + in OS and no synechiae were found. There was an improvement of the bilateral papillitis. The oncologist in charge of the patient and an ophthalmologist expert in uveitis considered the pembrolizumab to be the primary cause of ocular inflammation since the mechanism of action of the drug can induce ocular inflammation and there are similar cases reported in the literature.

To avoid activating the immune system, T cells have receptors that inhibit activation. Two of these receptors are CTLA-4 and PD-1. The metastatic cells of the melanoma are capable of expressing ligands for these receptors and hence, inhibit the activation of the immune system. Ipilimumab was the first of this family of drugs known as an immune checkpoint inhibitor, which acts by inhibiting the ligands of the CTLA-4 tumor cells and therefore T cells proliferate, invade the tumor cells, and help in the process of regression. Pembrolizumab acts in the same way but on PD-1 ligands.[6]\\n\\nThe mechanism that explains the development of ocular inflammation during the use of pembrolizumab is as follows: The presence of PD-1 ligand in ocular cells has been demonstrated and it is believed that the expression of these PD-1 ligands mediates in the ocular inflammation by inhibiting the proinflammatory cytokines produced by T cells. Thus, it is believed that the presence of PD-1 inhibitors can contribute to the development of ocular inflammation.[1]'], hint: None\n",

Considering age, sex, serum urea, creatinine level, and glomerular filtration rate, she suffered from mild and transient kidney injury. So kidney injury could not be reason of pulmonary edema.\\n\\nSevere CCB poisoning is often associated with significant hyperglycemia due to L-type calcium channel in pancreatic β-cells [21], as well as dysregulation of the insulin-dependent or phosphatidylinositol three-kinase pathway [22]. However, in this case glucose plasma levels were between 151 and 184\\u2009mg/dL for initial four days that may show a role in the ultimate degree of toxicity.\\n\\nAnother finding in this case was the development of mild respiratory and metabolic alkalosis. However, metabolic acidosis has been reported in most of the reported cases [5–16]. Metabolic acidosis could be resulting from systemic hypotension and acute kidney injury.\\n\\nARDS manifests with diffuse alveolar inflammation and increased pulmonary vascular permeability resulting in hypoxemia [23].

There was disease progression despite therapy with mycophenolate and intravenous immunoglobulin. Serial intravitreal injections of triamcinolone resulted in restoration of photoreceptor anatomy on optical coherence tomography and visual improvement.

Approximately 50\\u2009% of patients with CAR present with visual symptoms before the diagnosis of a malignancy is made [3]. CAR is rare, and there are currently no standard treatment regimens for the condition [4]. Systemic corticosteroids, steroid-sparing immunosuppression, and non-traditional immunomodulatory therapies including intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) have been shown to variably preserve or improve vision [5–7]. Cystoid macular edema (CME) has been reported in patients with non-paraneoplastic autoimmune retinopathy (npAIR) but is less common with CAR [2]. We report a patient with CAR in whom serial intravitreal steroid injections resulted in maintenance of visual function for more than 2\\xa0years until his death.\\n\\nCase report\\n\\nA 67-year-old man presented with decreased vision, photopsias, and nyctalopia. Examination revealed best corrected visual acuities of 20/32 in the right eye and 20/25 in the left eye. Dilated fundus exam was remarkable for bilateral CME and arteriolar narrowing (Fig.\\xa01a). Fluorescein angiography (FA) revealed petalloid leakage at the fovea, perivascular leakage, and disk staining bilaterally (Fig.\\xa01b). Multifocal and full-field electroretinography (ERG) revealed severely decreased scotopic and photopic responses but no negative ERG pattern. Serologic testing revealed the presence of antibodies to a 46-kDa retinal protein that was confirmed to be alpha enolase. Systemic evaluation for malignancy uncovered poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Chemotherapy was initiated with carboplatin and paclitaxel.

      "Predicting with title: Intravitreal triamcinolone for cancer-associated retinopathy refractory to systemic therapy., context: ['This report describes the successful treatment of CAR with intravitreal steroids. The treatment of CAR is often challenging. Treatment of the underlying malignancy alone does not alter the course of the ocular disease. Various treatment modalities have been tried in patients with CAR, including oral and intravenous steroids, plasmapheresis, IVIg, rituximab, azathioprine, cyclosporine, and mycophenolate mofetil [2, 6–8]. Despite treatment with these systemic medications, it is not unusual to have a progressive decline in vision with this disease. Our patient responded initially to systemic steroids but did not have an alteration of his disease course with mycophenolate mofetil or IVIg. After initiation of IVTA injections, his vision improved. Vision improvement in CAR is unusual; vision stabilization is often the best that can be hoped for. In this patient, there was strong evidence for a causal relationship between the injections and visual improvement. When the intravitreal triamcinolone wore off, his vision declined. With his initial injections, the improvement in vision could be attributed, at least in part, to treatment of the CME. But subsequent injections were given when there were no retinal cystic changes or thickening present on OCT and yet reinjection led to marked subjective and objective improvement. The improvement was likely due to suppression of inflammation around the photoreceptors as evidenced by restoration of inner segment/outer segment junction and resolution of hyperreflective lesions along the photoreceptor layer on OCT after the injections. In one such instance, his vision recovered from hand motions to 20/32 OS.'], hint: None\n",

There is one case report of retinal periphlebitis associated with CAR in a patient with ovarian cancer [9]. In the presence of CME, intravitreal steroids have previously been shown to be effective in patients with npAIR [2]. The unique presentation of CAR with CME and vasculitis in our patient motivated the use of intraocular triamcinolone, but there was evidence for an effect on the course of CAR directly given the visual improvements even when IVTA injected in the absence of CME. The presence of anti-retinal antibodies in the sera of patients with CAR suggests the need for systemic intervention in general, but this patient’s course suggests that a subset of CAR patients might be successfully treated with local therapy. The OCT photoreceptor findings in this patient pre- and post-injection indicate that intravitreal steroids may be able to successfully suppress inflammation and apoptosis induced by the autoantibodies at the level of the photoreceptors despite ongoing systemic production and/or circulation of antibodies. Some authors caution that readministration of intravitreal steroid for recurrent CME in npAIR and CAR is best done early when cystic changes are just starting to recur to avoid cycles of retinal cyst expansion and collapse which may cause retinal damage [2, 10]. Similarly, CAR patients without CME being treated with intravitreal steroids should be followed closely with OCT imaging and retreated promptly when evidence of photoreceptor layer disruption becomes apparent to avoid permanent photoreceptor damage.\\n\\nIn summary, intravitreal steroids should be considered in patients with CAR who do not respond to systemic therapy.

Patients with severe mental illness have a higher risk of developing the condition compared to the general population. Methods: We observed 10 cases of VTE in patients with mental illness who were treated with the antipsychotic drug olanzapine. The diagnosis of VTE was made at the University Hospital Hradec Kralove (UH HK) from 2004 to 2013. VTE was objectively determined by imaging techniques (duplex ultrasonography, CT angiography) and laboratory tests (D-dimer). The average age was 46 years. The clinical manifestation of VTE was deep vein thrombosis in nine cases, including one case of simultaneous pulmonary embolism and one case of a concurrent ischemic cerebrovascular accident (iCVA). None of our patients had a history of malignant disease, trauma, or surgery. Results: Apart from antipsychotic medication, all the patients had clinical or laboratory risk factors for VTE. The most frequent clinical risk factors were obesity (n = 7) and smoking (n = 6). The most frequent laboratory risk factors were increased levels of FVIII (n = 4), mild hyperhomocysteinemia (n = 3), and factor V Leiden mutation (n = 2). VTE developed within 3 months after antipsychotic drug initiation in three patients and within 6 months in three patients. Conclusion: Olanzapine can be considered a precipitating factor for VTE formation. When olanzapine is administered, we need to monitor for clinical signs and symptoms of VTE, especially when other risk factors are present.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nVenous thromboembolism (VTE) is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition. Manifestations of VTE include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). VTE is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Considerable amounts of money are also spent on the treatment of VTE in the developed countries of Europe and North America. VTE affects approximately 1.0–1.8 people per 1,000 annually (1, 2). The incidence rises exponentially with age, and the risk significantly increases in people over the age of 40 years (3). Multiple risk factors are involved in the development of VTE. VTE risk factors can be divided into physiological and pathophysiological, clinical and laboratory, and congenital and acquired factors (\\nTable 1\\n) (1, 2, 4).\\n\\nTable 1 Risk factors for VTE [adapted from Refs.

The risk of thrombosis rises significantly when multiple factors occur together. In older patients, acquired risk factors occur more frequently, which explains the significantly increased incidence of VTE in the elderly population.\\n\\nThe pathophysiological mechanism underlying VTE formation is the development of a relative thrombophilic state. This involves a shift in the hemostatic system towards thrombosis. If a genetic disposition is prominent in the etiopathogenesis of VTE, patients are determined to have hereditary thrombophilia. If external risk factors prevail, the condition is determined to be an acquired hypercoagulable state. A hypercoagulable state may result from the presence of any of the conditions belonging to the so-called Virchow triad (venous stasis, hypercoagulability, and vessel wall damage) (1, 2).\\n\\nIn patients with a mental illness, the risk of VTE is increased for several reasons. In a previous study, we found significantly increased activation of markers of thrombogenesis (sP-selectin, D-dimer, FVIII) in untreated patients experiencing a first episode of psychosis compared to healthy volunteers (5). The markers of thrombogenesis continued to be elevated after 1 year of treatment (6). Antiphospholipid antibodies (APAs), especially anticardiolipin antibodies (ACLAs), may serve as a marker of autoimmune reactivity, or they may directly interfere with phospholipid metabolism in schizophrenia patients. They may also have prothrombogenic effects. Inflammatory markers are also elevated during acute psychosis, which may lead to an increased risk of pathological blood coagulation (7). Hyperhomocysteinemia, which is also a risk factor for VTE, can occur in patients with mental disorders who also smoke, have poor dietary habits, and consume excessive amounts of coffee\\n\\nAntipsychotic medications are another risk factor for VTE in patients with a psychotic disease (8). Antipsychotic drugs contribute to the development of a hypercoagulable state through several potential mechanisms, including drug-induced sedation, obesity, hyperprolactinemia, increased platelet aggregation, and elevation of APA (5, 9).'], hint: None\n",

The highest risk of VTE emerges during the first 3 months after initiation of antipsychotic treatment (12). Other studies found the highest risk in the first month after the initiation of an antipsychotic (13, 14). In addition to the time period following drug administration and the antipsychotic drug class used, other risk factors include using higher drug doses, using a combination of several antipsychotic drugs, and parenteral administration of antipsychotic agents (15).\\n\\nThrough a long-term project named ANTRE (ANTipsychotics, ThRombosis, Embolism) involving interdisciplinary cooperation within the University Hospital in Hradec Kralove, we have been aiming to develop a comprehensive approach to the issue of VTE in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Cases of VTE development are carefully recorded. In addition to isolated case reports of VTE development during treatment with different antipsychotic agents, we recorded 10 cases involving the administration of olanzapine.\\n\\nPatients and Methods\\nThe patient group consisted of a total of 10 patients (women n = 3) who were treated with olanzapine. VTE occurrence was monitored prospectively between 2004 and 2013 in a specialized outpatient unit for VTE treatment. The average age of the patients was 46 years, with a range of 17 to 71 years. Three patients had a diagnosis of delusional disorder, two had paranoid schizophrenia, and two had bipolar disorder. The other patient diagnoses were an addiction to multiple narcotic drugs, behavioral disorder related to pregnancy and puerperium, and mental retardation with a behavioral disorder. The duration of psychiatric illness prior to the occurrence of VTE was determined. We also determined the duration and dose of olanzapine utilized prior to VTE and recorded other psychotropic drugs taken concomitantly. Information was collected from patient-reported history, the hospital information system, and reports by attending outpatient psychiatrists. None of the patients had previously suffered from VTE. Patient history was used to determine if there was a family history (FH) of VTE. In the patient group, VTE occurred either during hospitalization or during outpatient care. VTE diagnosis and subsequent treatment were conducted by an internist. If clinical symptoms suggested VTE, then additional examinations were conducted.

It is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. In clinical practice, the spectrum of its use is much wider. Off-label indications include psychotic disorders of various etiologies (toxic and organic), behavioral disorders in patients with dementia, eating disorders, and personality disorders. The relatively high incidence of olanzapine-related VTE may be distorted by the high number of patients treated with this antipsychotic agent.\\n\\nA possible prothrombogenic mechanism of olanzapine at the molecular level is an affinity for 5-HT2A serotonin receptors. Blocking these receptors results in increased platelet aggregation and increased blood coagulability (16). Blockade of α1 adrenergic receptors by olanzapine may cause hypotension and thereby venous stasis in the lower limbs. Another mechanism may be olanzapine-induced production of the antiphospholipid antibodies: lupus anticoagulant (LA) and ACLAs (17). Increasing these APA titers is associated with a prothrombogenic state (18). Olanzapine may also induce a temporary increase in prolactin levels early in the course of treatment. Hyperprolactinemia correlates with increased levels of P-selectin, a platelet activation marker (19).\\n\\nMetabolic symptoms caused by olanzapine represent an indirect mechanism for VTE development. The prothrombogenic metabolic symptoms that often occur during olanzapine treatment include hyperglycemia, hyperleptinemia, dyslipidemia, and weight gain (20). Weight gain is mainly due to the blockade of H1 histamine and 5-HT2C serotonin receptors by olanzapine.\\n\\nObesity [body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30)] is associated with an up to two-fold increase in the risk of VTE development. Obese patients have reduced fibrinolytic activity and capacity. Higher levels of the procoagulation factors FVIII and FIX also occur (21).

They mostly cause nosocomial infections associated with surgical procedures. This case study is the first report of a Raoultella infection in Africa. Case presentation We report a case of a surgical site infection (SSI) caused by Raoultella planticola which developed after caesarean section (CS) and surgery for secondary small bowel obstruction. The patient became febrile with neutrophilia (19,157/µL) 4\\xa0days after laparotomy and started to develop clinical signs of a SSI on the 8th day after laparotomy. The patient continued to be febrile and became critically ill despite empirical treatment with ceftriaxone and vancomycin. Raoultella species with extended antimicrobial resistance (AMR) carrying the CTX-M-9 β-lactamase was isolated from the wound discharge. Considering the antimicrobial susceptibility test, ceftriaxone was replaced by ceftazidime. The patient recovered and could be discharged on day 29 after CS.\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nRaoultella planticola was isolated from an infected surgical site after repeated abdominal surgery. Due to the infection the patient's stay in the hospital was prolonged for a total of 4\\xa0weeks. It is noted that patients undergoing surgical and prolonged inpatient treatment are at risk for infections caused by Raoultella. The development of a SSI caused by Raoultella planticola with extended AMR has to be assumed to be a consequence of ineffective antibiotic utilization. The presented case advices that rare bacteria as Raoultella should be considered as potential cause of nosocomial SSI with challenging treatment due to high levels of AMR.\\n\\nBackground\\nRaoultella are Gram-negative rod-shaped aerobic bacteria growing in water and soil. They can also be detected in the human gastrointestinal tract (GIT) or upper respiratory tract (URT) and are a rare cause of mostly nosocomial infections in humans. They were defined as a new genus in the family of Enterobacteriaceae in 2001, based on gene sequences of its 16S rRNA and rpoB gene [1].

The chemotherapy was administered through a Poweport® device, the position of which was confirmed with fluoroscopy and function confirmed by flushing the line. Urgent intervention was required as patient was symptomatic and experienced severe right-sided pleuritic chest pain. Radiology also confirmed the extravasation of doxorubicin into the pleural space.

Use of dexrazoxane should always be considered following intra-pleural extravasation because of its potential efficacy and reasonable tolerability. However, the best approach to extravasation injury is prevention by systematic implementation of careful, standardized, evidence-based administration techniques.\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\nAnthracycline extravasation is a feared complication of intravenous (i.v.) chemotherapy due to the tissue toxicity of this group of drugs. The reported incidence of the chemotherapy extravasation in the literature varies from 0.01% to 6% [1, 2]. However extravasation into thorax is rare, so far only 10 cases have been reported [1, 3]. A retrospective single centre study showed that improvement in staff training reduced the incidence of this complication by a factor of 10 (0.1–0.001%) over 15 years.\\n\\nVesicant injuries can progress within hours or days, resulting in lasting tissue injury and necrosis. Management is considered an emergency requiring combination of medical and surgical care.\\n\\nManagement of dermal extravasation is well established often requiring reconstructive surgical repair and use of DMSO which is a topical agent [2]. The effects of these agents into pleural or lung tissue are not well defined and there are no standard approaches in the management of accidental intra-pleural extravasation.\\n\\nOur case report describes a 54-year-old female who presented with intra-pleural extravasation of doxorubicin from a malpositioned central venous catheter. Management consisted of urgent surgical intervention and dexrazoxane, which proved to be effective in the long run.\\n\\nCASE REPORT\\nA 54-year-old woman (Mrs XY) was transferred from another facility for management of iatrogenic infusion of doxorubicin into the pleural space through a migrated central venous catheter.\\n\\nHer only medical history was stage IIIA left breast cancer oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive.

Prior to the first cycle of chemotherapy, long-term central venous access was established using a Poweport® device. This was inserted through the right subclavian vein using Seldinger technique and no complications were noted at time of procedure. The line position was confirmed with fluoroscopy and function confirmed by flushing the line (see Fig. 1).\\nFigure 1: Position of the line confirmed with fluoroscopy and function confirmed by flushing the line\\n\\n\\n\\nRoutine chest X-ray following procedure demonstrated correct catheter position with no complications.\\n\\nThe first cycle of chemotherapy consisting of 85 mg of i.v. doxorubicin (60 mg/m2) in 50 ml of normal saline and 850 mg of cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2) was given 5 days post-insertion of the port. Prior to the administration of the cytotoxic agents, it was noted that there was no withdrawal of blood from the port on aspiration. Doxorubicin infusion was commenced by nurses as they were able to infuse a flush solution without resistance. Following 6 ml (10 mg) of infused doxorubicin, Mrs XY complained of severe right-sided pleuritic chest pain. Fluoroscopy contrast study demonstrated that central venous catheter had curled unusually, causing perforation of superior vena cava or the azygos vein and migrated into the pleural space (see Fig. 2).\\nFigure 2: Fluoroscopy contrast study showing contrast medium flowed over the surface of the lung in the pleural cavity. The Port-A-Cath tubing tip is now in the pleural cavity.\\n\\n\\n\\nMrs XY was transferred to our institution for urgent surgical washout of the pleural space and i.v. dexrazoxane. She received i.v. dexrazoxane within 6 hours of extravasation. A dose of 1000 mg/m2 was used, administered immediately before the operation followed by 500 mg/m2 daily for 2 days post-operatively.\\n\\nA right thoracoscopic-assisted pleural lavage was performed the same day. The tip of the central catheter was visually identified lodged in the pleural space but there was no frank pneumonitis or direct parenchymal injury to the lung. The catheter was not broken and sutures were found to be intact.

Compared with other types of injectable anti-tumour drugs, anthracyclines have the potential to cause the most damage or complications because of their mechanism of action on tissue when they extravasate. Anthracyclines bind to the nucleic acids in the DNA of healthy tissues when they leak out of a vein. This process causes cell death and continues to do so as more drug is released into the surrounding tissue. These injuries can become larger, deeper and more painful as the cycle repeats itself [2].\\n\\nCentral venous catheters are frequently used for infusion of vesicant drugs as they provide reliable venous access, high-flow rates and rapid drug dilution. Unfortunately, they may also involve complications, including drug extravasation.\\n\\nImplementation of proper guidelines regarding use of venous catheters for chemotherapy can minimize or prevent complications. Location of the catheter tip should be in high-flow vessels to prevent cytostatic accumulation, which may lead to catheter thrombosis and vessel wall perforation [1]. Prior to anthracycline administration, it is critical to ensure port or peripheral catheter patency and position radiographically. Furthermore, it is necessary to reconfirm the positioning of the catheter when it is not possible to draw blood or infuse a flush solution prior to start of the chemotherapy infusion [4]. In this case, by means of brief aspiration of blood before giving anthracycline, followed by flushing of sodium chloride or glucose solution may have resulted in the detection of the catheter displacement.\\n\\nIndications of extravasation include symptoms of pain or fever. Lab investigations most frequently reveal leucocytosis. Radiology, most preferably CT scan, should be used for diagnosis of extravasation [1, 3, 4].'], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: Management of anthracycline extravasation into the pleural space., context: ['Immediate discontinuation of the infusion and aspiration of as much solution as possible through the central venous catheter must be done in all cases of extravasation [3]. Identification of local extravasation and surgical intervention wherever feasible to remove as much of the agent as possible [3] and at the same time administering dexrazoxane must be instituted to prevent major complications [4].\\n\\nBefore the approval of dexrazoxane for anthracycline extravasation, topical DMSO, ice application and/or use of steroids were recommended as a plausible approach. In the review of intrathoracic extravasation of chemotherapeutic agents from implanted ports by Bozkurt et al., anthracycline extravasation was reported in two cases and one case was in combination with five fluorouracil. Most of the patients developed pleural effusion like our Mrs. XY or pericardial effusion. Management consisted of aspiration of the residual drug as much as possible before removing the catheter, flushing of the cavities with normal saline and/or systemic administration of steroids. Surprisingly, all of them had a favourable outcome [3].\\n\\nIn 2007, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved dexrazoxane for injection for the treatment of extravasation resulting from i.v. anthracycline chemotherapy [5]. Dexrazoxane acts as a reversible topoisomerase II inhibitor and ring chelating agent, thereby reducing the formation of anthracycline–iron complexes, which are toxic to surrounding tissue [2, 4].\\n\\nIn Europe, two prospective clinical studies of the efficacy of dexrazoxane (TT01 and TT02) in preventing the potentially devastating effects of biopsy-proven anthracycline extravasation in the skin demonstrated that dexrazoxane treatment is highly effective both on a short and long-term basis. Epirubicin was involved in 56% of the cases, 41% were treated with doxorubicin while two received daunorubicin. Four out of 57 had extravasation involving central venous access device and none of them required surgical intervention. The 3 day treatment schedule with dexrazoxane consisting of a daily dose of 1000 mg/m2 on days 1–2 and 500 mg/m2 on day 3 proved effective in preventing surgery-requiring necrosis. Haematological toxicities and transient elevation of liver enzymes associated with dexrazoxane were manageable [2, 6].\\n\\nSince FDA approval of dexrazoxane, subsequent clinical case reports have supported the above-mentioned study findings, and the systemic antidotal treatment has shown value in anthracycline extravasation. Promising results were obtained from a 2007 to 2010 Belgian survey involving 41 patients treated with dexrazoxane from 29 centres. It showed that surgical debridement due to anthracycline extravasation could be avoided in 95.1% of cases (39/41 extravasations) with use of dexrazoxane with manageable toxicities reported in only 8/41 cases [2].'], hint: None\n",

[4] regarding the evolution and management of intra-pleural extravasation through a CVAD using dexrazoxane resulting in a favourable long-term outcome with similar strategy.\\n\\nIn conclusion, prevention is the best approach for managing chemotherapy extravasation. Prior to using venous catheters, their position and function should be adequately checked, with adherence to surgical and oncological procedures. Anthracyclines should be administered as a short infusion only in the presence of healthcare professionals with oncology training.\\n\\nA prospective clinical trial involving the use of dexrazoxane in intra-pleural extravasation is unlikely.

Introduction\\nCrimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is an arthropod-borne viral infection that infects domestic and wild animals and can be transmitted to humans via several routes. The causative agent of CCHF is an RNA virus of the genus Nairovirus belonging to the Bunyaviridae family of viruses (1). Over several decades, serious outbreaks with high case-fatality rates have been reported from different parts of the world, including the Middle East (2-6). CCHF is becoming a global problem, and more cases are expected to be diagnosed as the disease becomes endemic to more areas due to movement of livestock, changes in hunting activities and agricultural practices (7). A real threat exists to health care workers managing patients with CCHF and causing nosocomial outbreaks, which may have high fatality rates (8). Another concern is related to the potential use of the virus as a weapon of bioterrorism, given the limited availability of diagnostic laboratory services with Biosafety Level 4 facilities (9).\\n\\nCCHF is not endemic to UAE; however, two documented limited outbreaks occurred in 1979 and 1994 and were associated with high mortality rates among infected health care workers (10, 11).

Epidermal necrolysis spectrum eruptions such as Stevens–Johnson Syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are considered a continuum and share the same pathogenesis. They are only differentiated on the body surface area by epidermal detachment [2]. Epidermal detachment of\\u2009<\\u200910%, 10–30% and\\u2009>\\u200930% are designated as SJS, SJS/TEN and TEN, respectively [2, 3]. The mortality rate ranges from 1 to 5% for SJS, and 25 to 35% for TEN [2].\\n\\nSJS and TEN are rare severe cutaneous reactions with annual incidences of 1.2–6 and 0.4–1.2 per million people, respectively [4, 5]. The common cause of SJS/TEN is drug exposure, while infections, contrast media, and vaccinations are mainly linked to SJS. Drugs commonly associated with the development of SJS/TEN include cotrimoxazole, nevirapine, allopurinol, sulfasalazine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, lamotrigine, and carbamazepine [1]. The estimated incidence of cutaneous adverse drug reactions (CADRs) to psychotropic medications among psychiatric inpatients is 2–5% [6]. Lange-Asschenfeldt et al. observed that antiepileptic drug (AED) mood stabilizers accounted for the highest CADR rate as a drug group, followed by antidepressants, while antipsychotics were the least commonly involved medications in CADRs [6]. Psychotropics with a high risk of epidermal necrolysis are carbamazepine, lamotrigine and phenobarbital [3]. Recent studies have also reported on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)-induced epidermal necrolysis, and have implicated fluoxetine, paroxetine, fluvoxamine and mirtazapine [7–11].

      "Predicting with title: An Interesting Case of Carbamazepine-Induced Stevens-Johnson Syndrome., context: ['Carbamazepine is a well-known causative agent of drug-induced SJS among psychotropics [3]. Rare cases of SSRI-induced epidermal necrolysis, i.e. SJS and TEN, have been described in the literature [7–11]. To our knowledge, no cases of epidermal necrolysis have been described with coadministration of carbamazepine and an SSRI. In the case presented, the patient had been taking carbamazepine for 14\\xa0days after discontinuing fluoxetine. The temporal relationship between the development of SJS after the addition of carbamazepine suggests that carbamazepine was the causative agent. Although the median latency period (interquartile range) for the development of SJS with carbamazepine is 15\\xa0days (12–20) [12], latency periods of 4\\xa0weeks have also been reported [13]. The latency period for SSRI-induced SJS is 1–3\\xa0weeks. Using the Algorithm of Drug causality for Epidermal Necrolysis (ALDEN) scoring system for SJS/TEN, carbamazepine scored +6 and fluoxetine scored +2. Therefore, carbamazepine and fluoxetine were considered ‘very probable’ and ‘possible’ causes of SJS, respectively, in our patient [14].\\n\\nCarbamazepine-induced SJS has long been thought of as an idiosyncratic, dose independent, unpredictable adverse event specific to an individual [15]; however, current evidence indicates that carbamazepine-induced SJS/TEN is a predictable, specific, delayed hypersensitivity immune reaction involving human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles specific for carbamazepine and other drugs in defined populations [16]. HLA-B*15:02 and HLA-B*31:01 have been associated with carbamazepine-induced SJS in Asian (Han Chinese, Thai, Indian and Malaysian) and Caucasian (and Japanese) populations, respectively [17–19]. Recent evidence suggests this possibility, as shown by the phenytoin and nevirapine-induced SJS/TEN associated with reduced drug clearance due to metaboliser enzyme polymorphisms [20, 21]. However, we were not able to genotype our patient for HLA alleles, therefore we cannot confirm the involvement of the phenotype-specific characteristics of the patient that might have contributed to the development of SJS. Although association with specific HLA genotypes may be necessary, it is not sufficient for the development of SJS/TEN [18]. Other factors such as the individual variation in drug metabolism or clearance, HIV-1 seropositivity, polypharmacy, and competitive drug inhibition may also play an important role in SJS/TEN development with carbamazepine [1, 18, 22, 23].'], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: An Interesting Case of Carbamazepine-Induced Stevens-Johnson Syndrome., context: ['It has been postulated that no biologic effect is dose-independent [24] and that immune-mediated reactions only occur when a critical dose threshold has been reached [15, 25]. The maximum incidence for idiosyncratic reactions is often at a dose below the therapeutic range and remains constant within the therapeutic range [24]; however, this biologic dose-dependency principle (and possibly immune tolerance) is used successfully in desensitisation protocols for the safe introduction of medicines known to have idiosyncratic reactions [15, 24, 25]. Given the current understanding of idiosyncratic reactions, a potential increase in carbamazepine plasma concentration due to CYP3A4 inhibition by fluoxetine and norfluoxetine may have reached the threshold for the immune-mediated carbamazepine-induced SJS in our patient, leading to the observed adverse reaction [25, 26]. Increases in plasma carbamazepine or its metabolites increases the likelihood of adverse events, and possibly SJS, as occurs with phenytoin [27, 28]. It is possible that prior administration with fluoxetine may have increased the risk for SJS in our patient. The inhibitory capacity on CYP3A4 substrate clearance can persist up to 3\\xa0weeks post administration of fluoxetine due to the long half-life of norfluoxetine [29]. In our patient, carbamazepine was administered 14\\xa0days after fluoxetine was discontinued; however, we were unable to measure plasma concentrations of carbamazepine to confirm that competitive inhibition of metabolic enzymes by fluoxetine or norfluoxetine was involved in the development of SJS in our patient. Therefore, we cannot conclude that prior administration of fluoxetine may have increased the risk of carbamazepine-induced SJS.\\n\\nAlthough epidermal necrolysis is rare with the use of SSRIs, several case reports have been documented for SJS or TEN with mirtazapine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine and paroxetine [6–10]. Many of the reported cases have occurred in female patients who had received an SSRI for a duration ranging from 3 to 14\\xa0days. In our case, the patient had discontinued fluoxetine for 14\\xa0days when she developed SJS. However, fluoxetine and its major metabolite norfluoxetine have long elimination half-lives of 1–4 days and 7–15\\xa0days, respectively [30].

However, the occurrence of serious adverse events may cause a decline in QOL. We investigated the relationship between outpatient chemotherapy-induced adverse events and QOL.\\n\\n\\nMETHODS\\nA single-center retrospective descriptive study was conducted in patients who received outpatient chemotherapy at Gifu University Hospital (Gifu, Japan) between September 2017 and December 2018. The utility values of QOL, type and severity of adverse events, type of cancer, chemotherapy regimen, and other patient demographics were analyzed.

Moreover, cancer chemotherapy has transitioned from inpatient to outpatient settings because of advancements in supportive care measures against cancer and changes in the healthcare environment to reduce medical costs [1–4]. Hence, patients are able to continue their personal life and work by undergoing chemotherapy in an outpatient setting. In fact, Ishiura et al.

Furthermore, Mark et al.

The Japanese version of the EQ-5D-5L was developed by Shiroiwa et al. [14] to evaluate QOL reflecting Japanese values. The EQ-5D-5L is widely used in clinical studies and health status surveys targeting the general population and uses a comprehensive scale based on preferences to assess cardinal changes in health status [15, 16]. While the values in the Japanese version [14] differ from those in the original, the utility values of QOL in this study were calculated using the Japanese version of the EQ-5D-5L to reflect the values of the Japanese people. We used a hybrid model prepared by mapping discrete choice experiment (DCE) data onto composite time trade-off (cTTO) data [14] to determine the EQ-5D-5L utility value.\\n\\nWe applied to the EuroQoL Group for use of the Japanese version of the questionnaire and obtained permission before use. The Japanese version of the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire was used in face-to-face interviews to estimate the utility values of QOL [14] and was routinely implemented by pharmacists during each patient visit. The utility values were recorded in the hospital’s electronic medical records.\\n\\nThe five dimensions assessed by the EQ-5D-5L are mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each of these is assessed according to five levels of severity: level 1, no problem; level 2, slight problem; level 3, moderate problem; level 4, severe problem; and level 5, unable or extreme problem [13]. A utility value ranging from 0 to 1 was calculated from the EQ-5D-5L, which was defined as the primary outcome of this study. According to the Japanese version of the utility value conversion table, “0” indicates death and “1” indicates full health [17]. The EQ-5D-5L contains only five questions, and patients receiving outpatient chemotherapy can easily answer these questions at each cycle. For these reasons, we used the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire in the present study.\\n\\nAssessment of adverse events\\nAll patients were provided with a daily checklist to confirm their side effects on their first visit to the outpatient chemotherapy clinic.

Therefore, we investigated the changes in QOL induced by anticancer drugs in patients with peripheral neuropathy. These changes were examined at three time points: prior to peripheral sensory neuropathy (control), during the development of peripheral sensory neuropathy (pre-intervention), and after pharmaceutical intervention for peripheral sensory neuropathy (post-intervention).\\n\\nSpecifically, to show that utility values for QOL were reduced by the appearance of peripheral neuropathy, we compared utility values for QOL between “control” and “pre-intervention” time points. In addition, to show that the effect of pharmaceutical intervention for peripheral neuropathy increased utility values for QOL, we compared utility values for QOL between “pre-intervention” and “post-intervention” time points.\\n\\nStatistical analysis\\nPatient demographics were summarized using medians with the 25th and 75th percentiles for parametric variables. Frequencies and percentages are shown for non-parametric variables. As the distribution of the EQ-5D-5L utility value was heavily skewed, we employed proportional odds logistic regression to assess the effect of adverse events on QOL after adjusting for covariates.

This model performs well for skewed continuous outcome variables using the ranks of data. In addition to the moving difference between the current and previous grade of adverse events (changing grade), age and sex were included in the multivariable model. Adjusted associations were analyzed using a regression model with the Huber-White robust sandwich estimator, with patients as a clustering variable. In the secondary analysis, we confirmed the effect of cancer type and anticancer drugs on the EQ-5D-5L utility value using a proportional odds logistic model with adjustment for covariates. An adjusted odds ratio < 1 indicates that QOL is more likely to be worse on average in patients with adverse events, cancer, or those taking anticancer drugs.

Organ systems that rely most on aerobic metabolism, such as the brain, heart and the skeletal muscle, are more inclined to be influenced by mitochondrial dysfunction.

The term of isolated mitochondrial myopathy refers to the condition where mitochondrial disorders primarily affect the skeletal muscle system.

After expectant treatment of oxygen inhalation, he recovered to a relative stable condition and drove home. He developed increasing shortness of breath in the following days, which eventually deteriorated into acute respiratory failure. Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis showed a pH of 7.25, and a PaCO2 of 86.25 mmHg. Although the PaO2 level was in a normal range by treatment of oxygen inhalation, the diagnosis of type II respiratory failure was considered because of hypercapnia. A pulmonary function test suggested a moderate restrictive ventilator impairment. No evidence of pneumonia or bronchitis was found through Computed Tomography (CT) scanning.

Here, we present the unique case with metastatic GISTs who derived clinical benefit from apatinib following the failure of imatinib and sunitinib. Case presentation: A 57-year-old man was admitted to our hospital diagnosed with metastatic and recurrent GISTs following surgical resection. Fifty-four months after the first-line imatinib treatment, he developed progressive disease and then was treated with cytoreductive surgery combined with imatinib. Disease progression occurred after 7 months. He then received second-line sunitinib and achieved a progression-free survival of 11 months. Apatinib mesylate was then administered. Follow-up imaging revealed a stable disease. Progression-free survival following apatinib therapy was at least 8 months. The only toxicities were hypertension and proteinuria, which were both controllable and well-tolerated. Conclusions: Treatment with apatinib provides an additional option for the treatment of patients with GISTs refractory to imatinib and sunitinib.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nGastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal neoplasms of the gastrointestinal tract (1). Most GISTs harbor activating mutations in either gene encoding KIT or platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α (PDGFRA) (2, 3), which are type III receptor tyrosine kinases (4). After the identification of activating mutations, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are used for GISTs (5), which also significantly improved prognosis of patients with metastatic or recurrent disease (6). Imatinib mesylate is recommended as initial therapy based on drug activity and drug tolerability according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline for advanced GISTs (7). For patients with metastatic or unresectable GISTs after the failure of imatinib, sunitinib is considered (7). However, resistance to sunitinib eventually develops in most patients, after a median of 6–9 months (8). Although regorafenib can significantly improve survival as the third-line treatment, median progression-free survival (PFS) was only 4.8 months. Therefore, the development of efficacious and safe therapies is required for the treatment of metastatic or unresectable GISTs after the failure of imatinib and sunitinib.'], hint: None\n",

Similarly, apatinib is a potent VEGFR inhibitor apart from the KIT inhibitor. The role of VEGF in GISTs, however, has not been established. Imamura et al. suggested that angiogenesis associated with VEGF might play an important role in in the progression of GISTs (22). Several ex vivo studies of GIST specimens have demonstrated that microvessel density is associated with VEGF expression and closely related to the prognosis of the disease (23, 24). Recently, Verboom et al. proposed that SNPs in the genes encoding for VEGFR2 was associated with PFS in patients with advanced GISTs treated with imatinib (25). Consolino et al. suggested that VEGFR2 and VEGFR3 expression may be related to progression of imatinib-resistant GISTs, and the direct targeting of the receptors may have the potential to decrease tumor growth by the inhibition of angiogenesis (26). Thus, apatinib may have clinical benefits for patients with GISTs refractory to imatinib and sunitinib and need to be further tested in large-scale clinical trials.\\n\\nConclusion\\nThe present case demonstrates that apatinib provides an additional option in the treatment of patients with GISTs refractory to imatinib and sunitinib.

Currently, most research focuses on vaccine development or pharmacological treatment strategies for hospitalised patients with COVID-19.1 However, to reduce global morbidity and mortality, effective treatment strategies for non-hospitalised patients are required.\\n\\nFamotidine may be a candidate medication for this. Famotidine is a histamine-2 receptor antagonist, widely available over the counter at low cost, does not interact with other medications and has been safely used for suppression of gastric acid production over a wide range of oral doses from 20\\u2009mg once daily to 160\\u2009mg four times daily.2 In computer simulations, famotidine was identified as a potential inhibitor of the 3-chymotrypsin-like protease,3 and this and other potential mechanisms of action for famotidine in COVID-19 are an area of current research. In a propensity score matched retrospective cohort study a significantly reduced risk for death or intubation (adjusted HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.88) was identified for patients with COVID-19 who were incidentally taking famotidine before or at the point of hospital admission.4\\n\\n\\nThe incentive for the retrospective cohort study were the unexpected positive results from a group of 10 patients who took famotidine following onset of symptoms for COVID-19.

Information on patient demographics, comorbidities, COVID-19 test results, famotidine use, drug-related side effects, temperature measurements, oxygen saturations and symptom scores were obtained. We collected longitudinal severity scores on five symptoms (cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, headaches and anosmia), based on an NIH endorsed Protocol to research Patient Experience of COVID-19, in addition to general unwellness.5 Symptom scores were retrospectively provided by patients on an ordinal scale: 1=not affected, 2=little affected, 3=affected and 4=severely affected. This four-point scale was based on performance status scoring in patients with cancer who are systemically affected by illness or treatment. We adapted the first four scale points of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) scale6 and provided explanatory text to the patients as part of the symptom questionnaire. We chose only those scale points of the ECOG PS as measures of grades of severity that are relevant to a severity of COVID-19 illness that does not require hospitalisation.

We report a case of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-negative pauci-immune glomerulonephritis with massive intestinal bleeding and cerebral hemorrhage.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nPauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis (GN) is one of the most common causes of rapidly progressive GN (RPGN). Most patients with pauci-immune crescentic GN have glomerular disease as part of an antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)–associated systemic vasculitis, such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, or as a part of renal-limited vasculitis [1]. Because ~75–90% of patients with pauci-immune crescentic GN have circulating ANCA, ANCA is known as a major serologic marker to distinguish pauci-immune crescentic GN from other types of RPGN [2]. Although there is little information about ANCA-negative pauci-immune crescentic GN owing to a relatively small number of patients, several studies have reported fewer systemic vasculitis manifestations in ANCA-negative crescentic GN than ANCA-positive cases. Hemorrhagic complications in pauci-immune crescentic GN are common, but massive gastrointestinal bleeding or cerebral hemorrhage in ANCA-negative pauci-immune crescentic GN has rarely been reported. Herein, we report a rare case of recurrent massive intestinal bleeding that was caused by an uncontrolled vasculitis combined with ANCA-negative pauci-immune crescentic GN.\\n\\nCase report'], hint: None\n",

Pitting edema greater than Grade III of the lower limbs was noted. Lung auscultation was normal, and no purpura was found on the skin. Initial laboratory test results showed white blood cell count 8,300/mm3; hemoglobin 10.7\\xa0g/L; platelets 277,000/mm3; blood urea nitrogen 54.5\\xa0mg/dL; serum creatinine 3.5\\xa0mg/dL; total protein 5.9\\xa0g/dL; albumin 3.0\\xa0g/dL; total calcium 8.4\\xa0g/dL; phosphorus 5.0\\xa0mg/dL; prothrombin time (international normalized ratio) 1.08; and activated partial thromboplastin time 34 seconds. Urinalysis revealed many red blood cells (RBCs) per high-power field, and protein (4+) and occult blood (2+) were also detected. The spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio was 3.5\\xa0g/g.\\n\\nHer renal function deteriorated rapidly over 7 days (serum creatinine concentration increased from 3.5\\xa0mg/dL to 7.0\\xa0mg/dL) and exhibited features of RPGN. Therefore, we performed a renal biopsy and other serologic tests. The serum immunoglobulin levels, including immunoglobulin (Ig)G, IgM, and IgA, and complements, including C3 and C4, were within normal ranges. Immune serologic result was negative for antinuclear antibody and antiglomerular basement membrane antibody. ANCAs also showed negative in indirect immunofluorescence and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.\\n\\nThe renal biopsy specimen showed cellular or fibrocellular crescentic formation in 92% (57/62) of glomeruli (Fig. 1).

Initial resuscitation was conducted using a crystalloid solution and packed RBC transfusion. Although emergency gastroscopy and colonoscopy were performed, the bleeding focus was not detected, but a large amount of old blood was observed in the terminal ileum. After 2 days, a colonoscopy was performed again, but abnormal findings associated with bleeding were not detected. Then, a capsule endoscopy was attempted to determine if the bleeding focus was located in the small bowel. However, owing to a slow small bowel transit time, the entire small bowel could not be observed because the capsule did not reach the mid-to-distal ileum. On the 22nd hospital day, recurrent massive hematochezia occurred. Abdominal computed tomography angiography showed active arterial bleeding on the ileal loop, and selective superior mesenteric arteriography revealed an active contrast extravasation in a branch of the distal ileal artery (Fig. 3). We selectively performed embolization with a permanent embolic agent (n-butyl cyanoacrylate; 0.5\\xa0mL tissue adhesive, 1.5\\xa0mL ethionidized oil mixture), and the bleeding stopped.\\n\\nDespite successful embolization, massive hematochezia occurred again after 2 days. Her hemoglobin level was 6.5\\xa0g/dL, and platelet count was 40,000/mm3. The patient received two units of packed RBCs and five units of platelet concentrate. Emergency colonoscopy showed multiple segmental ulcerations on the terminal ileum, which was consistent with ischemic damage due to embolization of the distal ileal artery (Fig. 4). The patient underwent hemodialysis because of intractable metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, and fluid overload. Anemia associated with schistocytes and transfusion-refractory consumptive thrombocytopenia was also present, consistent with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA).

      "Predicting with title: Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-negative pauci-immune glomerulonephritis with massive intestinal bleeding., context: ['Pauci-immune crescentic GN is part of systemic small-vessel vasculitis and usually associated with the presence of ANCAs directed against myeloperoxidase or proteinase 3. Although the pathogenesis of ANCA in vasculitis is not fully understood, ANCA is known to activate neutrophils by different mechanisms, such as direct Fab02 binding to ANCA antigens on leukocyte surfaces or Fc receptor engagement by ANCA immune complexes, leading to apoptosis and necrosis of neutrophil and endothelial cells [3]. However, in ANCA-negative small-vessel vasculitis, neutrophil infiltration of the pathologic lesion is reportedly related with other unidentified autoantibodies or T-cell–dependent mechanisms [4].\\n\\nDespite limited information about ANCA-negative pauci-immune crescentic GN, ANCA-negative patients reportedly show severe renal manifestations, such as nephrotic-range proteinuria, poorer renal outcomes, and less extrarenal involvement such as fever, arthralgia, skin rash, abdominal pain, or mononeuritis multiplex, compared with ANCA-positive patients [5–7]. Similarly, our case also showed nephrotic-range proteinuria of 3.5\\xa0g/d and diffuse cellular crescentic formations in >90% of glomeruli on renal biopsy. Initially, extrarenal manifestations were not observed.\\n\\nOur patient had no evidence of asthma, eosinophilia, or granuloma of the upper respiratory tract. Based on the 2012 International Chapel Hill Consensus criteria, we were able to diagnose MPA and exclude granulomatosis with polyangiitis and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis from the possible systemic small-vessel vasculitis conditions. Hemorrhagic complications in patients with pauci-immune crescentic GN are common [8]. Small-vessel vasculitis can cause local or diffuse pathologic changes in the gastrointestinal tract, including ulcers, bowel wall edema, hemorrhage, paralytic ileus, ischemia, obstruction, and perforation [9–12]. Although necrotizing GN and pulmonary capillaritis are very common in MPA, several cases with gastrointestinal bleeding have been reported. Interestingly, a Japanese case diagnosed with MPA and pauci-immune crescentic GN showed active bleeding of the superior pancreaticoduodenal artery and iliac branch of the superior mesenteric artery [13]. The characteristics of this case were very similar to those of the present case: old age, absence of circulating ANCA, massive active bleeding, and absence of small artery involvement on kidney biopsy. However, our case showed a poor clinical course and a feature of MAHA. Thrombotic microangiopathy is characterized by platelet aggregation in systemic circulation, thrombocytopenia, and mechanical hemolysis. Although coexistence of thrombotic microangiopathy and pauci-immune crescentic GN is rare, pauci-immune crescentic GN could trigger thrombotic microangiopathy through endothelial damage by proinflammatory mediators [14]. Secondary ischemic multiple ulcerations after embolization, thrombocytopenia caused by consumption of platelets due to recurrent bleeding, and MAHA contribute to poor'], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-negative pauci-immune glomerulonephritis with massive intestinal bleeding., context: ['outcomes.\\n\\nInitiation of conventional treatment for pauci-immune crescentic GN with or without ANCA consists of intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy followed by progressive reduction of oral prednisolone (initially 1\\xa0mg/kg/24\\xa0h) and cyclophosphamide, either intravenously at a dose of 0.5–1\\xa0g/m2 or orally at a dose of 2–3\\xa0mg/kg/24\\xa0h [15]. Our patient received conventional treatment according to this schedule, but massive hematochezia occurred 15 days later. In life- or organ-threatening conditions, such as lung hemorrhage or severe ANCA-related renal vasculitis, plasma exchange may be recommended. In cases with gastrointestinal bleeding, widely accepted treatment methods are lacking. Therefore, our patient only received embolization without plasmapheresis or other immunosuppressants, based on previous reports. The causes of intracerebral bleeding in our patient were not clear. Although there was a high possibility of the hemorrhagic complications of systemic vasculitis, brain magnetic resonance angiography was not performed. Various factors that could increase bleeding tendency, such as a uremic condition, low platelet count, or frequent transfusions, may contribute to intracerebral bleeding.\\n\\nIn summary, to the best of our knowledge, there are only a few reports regarding ANCA-negative pauci-immune crescentic GN with massive gastrointestinal bleeding. Therefore, the present case is interesting and informative, reporting recurrent massive intestinal bleeding and fatal intracerebral bleeding as a serious hemorrhagic complication of ANCA-negative pauci-immune GN.\\n\\nConflicts of interest\\nThe authors have no conflicts of interest.\\n\\nFigure 1 Renal biopsy findings.

In the case of suspected hypersensitivity to local anesthetics, skin testing is considered to be a useful tool - patch tests and intradermal tests for delayed hypersensitivity and skin prick tests and intradermal tests for immediate reactions. There is a particular need for such a diagnostic procedure, as patients suspected of hypersensitivity to local anesthetic drugs are frequently admitted.\\n\\n\\nOBJECTIVE\\nTo highlight the problem of hypersensitivity to local anesthetics on the basis of authors' own experience and literature data.\\n\\n\\nMETHODS\\nWe present cases of 5 patients referred to the clinic by their dentists with a suspicion of allergy to local anesthetics, four to lidocaine and 1 to articaine.\\n\\n\\nRESULTS\\nIntradermal tests were positive in 1 out of 5 subjects, with a concomitant episode of urticaria. In 1 patient we obtained a doubtful result of intradermal tests. Skin prick tests and patch tests were negative in all cases. In 2 cases we performed an incremental challenge test also with a negative result.\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nIt has to be emphasized that, although rare, consequences of true allergy to local anesthetics can be serious considering a patient's future management and therapy. That is why this diagnosis may be crucial.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nLidocaine represents the most common local anesthetic (LA) agent employed in local or regional anesthesia, included as a constituent of EMLA, a eutectic mixture of lidocaine and prilocaine [1, 2]. Although most allergic reactions are due to the common metabolic product of the ester local anesthetic, para-amino benzoic acid, cross-reactivity among esters is common. Ingredients in LA solutions such as antioxidants or preservatives including metabisulphite or parabens may also elicit allergic or adverse reactions. Articaine solutions should be avoided in those allergic or hypersensitive to sulphite, due to the content of sodium metabisulphite as the vasoconstrictor's antioxidant in it. The LA (without preservatives or adrenaline) may be skin tested.\\n\\nTrue allergy to LA is rare, with a genuine immunological reaction representing only 1% of all adverse reactions to these medications [3–5]. In traditional classifications, adverse reactions to LA have been categorized as allergic, toxic and autonomic [3]. Most of the patients undergoing dental procedures exhibit some degree of autonomic response to an injection, such as sweating, tachycardia or even syncope. However, it is usually mild and transient. Toxic reactions are mostly observed as a consequence of a rapid intra-vascular injection of LA or may be associated with an overdose in patients defectively metabolizing the drug.\"], hint: None\n",

All patients were referred to our Department by their dentists with a suspicion of allergy to LA. In the case of 4 patients, lidocaine was suspected as a culprit drug; in 1 case, articaine was suspected.\\n\\nThree patients experienced an adverse reaction 2–2.5 months prior to diagnosis. In 2 subjects, the time interval between the reaction and diagnosis was much longer, being 17 and 25 years. Three patients had symptoms of an adverse reaction during a dental procedure involving the use of LA; 2 patients experienced an adverse reaction during tonsillectomy. In regards of the type of the adverse event, 2 patients experienced syncope, 1 had an episode of disseminated urticarial wheals and another had cardiac palpitations and anxiety. One female patient experienced an adverse reaction over 20 years earlier, for which there was no reliable documentation except the suggestion of a “severe immediate allergic reaction” by her family doctor.\\n\\nA thorough case history was recorded with the use of the Polish version of the European Network of Drug Allergy (ENDA) questionnaire [6, 7]. Skin prick tests (SPT) with chosen LA, followed by intradermal tests (IDT) were performed using 1: 10 000, 1: 1000 and 1: 100 dilutions for lidocaine and 1: 10 dilution for mepivacaine and articaine. We used LA preparations with no additional vasoconstrictors (e.g. epinephrine). All the procedures (STP followed by IDT if negative, dilution of examined medications) were performed thoroughly with the maximal safety considerations respected, especially in regards of possible immediate hypersensitivity reactions.\\n\\nHistamine and normal saline served as a positive and negative control, respectively. The SPT was considered positive when the mean diameter of an allergen wheal was equal or slightly larger than the mean diameter of the histamine wheal (+++) and when the mean diameter of an allergen wheal was at least twice as big as the mean diameter of the histamine wheal (++++) or in any case of response with pseudopodia (++++).

According to Wildsmith [10], among 25 patients initially diagnosed as being allergic to LA during dental treatment, 6 were diagnosed as suffering from phobia, panic or anxiety, 1 patient received an intravascular injection (adrenaline content of the cartridge), 1 patient appeared to be allergic to metabisulphite and latex allergy accounted for problems with 3 patients.'], hint: None\n",

In the majority of cases, hypersensitivity to this group of drugs may be excluded. It is suggested that the amide class of LA (lidocaine, mepivacaine, bupivacaine, articaine, prilocaine) is significantly less allergic than the ester type (benzocaine, procaine, tetracaine), There is also limited cross-reactivity between amide LA drugs [11]. However, according to data published by Zanni et al. [12], good agreement may be observed between clinical sensitization, PT and lymphocyte transformation test, indicating that there is a high degree of cross-reactivity between lidocaine and mepivacaine, also on the clonal level.\\n\\nAmong allergic reactions to LA, type IV hypersensitivity responses have been described predominantly to ester LA and clinically are represented by either contact dermatitis or rashes (macular or maculopapular) [13]. Torres et al. [14] also described the first case of fixed drug eruption induced by mepivacaine. This report was followed by others [15, 16]. Contact allergy to amide anesthetics is rare and, according to Klein and Gall [17] in 1991, only 18 cases had been reported since these medications began to be used in the 1940s. Most of the delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions take place after a topical application of the drug [18]. There have been also reports of cases presenting as contact dermatitis due to subcutaneous administration of LA, which have been confirmed by patch testing. Bircher et al. [13] described a case of a delayed-type reaction to LA with subsequent positive PT to lidocaine, mepivacaine and prilocaine but negative to articaine. Kanerva et al. [19] described a case of a 48-year-old patient, who developed contact dermatitis after an infiltration with mepivacaine and lidocaine and they concluded that diagnostic approach of a patient suspected of delayed-type hypersensitivity to LA should include not only PT, but also IDT.\\n\\nImmediate IgE-mediated allergic responses, particularly to amide type LA, are uncommon. According to some authors, in more than 30 years of their practice, there has never been verified an immediate allergic reaction to LA using available diagnostic technology [10]. However, there are case reports of adverse reactions to LA, suggesting type I hypersensitivity, where signs and symptoms tend to occur within minutes of drug injection and include urticaria, episodes of angioneurotic edema, wheezing, sneezing, pruritus or even anaphylactic shock [3, 10].'], hint: None\n",

The position of the line was confirmed with fluoroscopy and routine chest X‐ray (Fig 1).\\n\\nFigure 1 Chest X ray confirming the position of the central venous catheter.\\n\\nThe first cycle of chemotherapy consisted of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide.

This process causes cell death and continues to do so as more of the drug is released into the surrounding tissue, causing pain, as in the described case.2\\n\\n\\nThe topoisomerase II inhibitor and iron chelator, dexrazoxane, has been proven to prevent the potentially devastating effects of anthracycline extravasation. It is highly effective with minimal side effects and is well tolerated by patients.3 Dexrazoxane is approved by the Food and Drug Administration, but not the Therapeutic Goods Administration, and has limited availability in Australia.\\n\\nExtravasation is caused by mal‐positioning of central venous catheters, which can be classified as primary occurring at the time of placement, or secondary occurring sometime after placement. The causes of secondary mal‐positioning are poorly understood, as in our case, where initial investigation seemed to confirm correct positioning (Fig 1). Fracture and distal embolization of the catheter as part of the “pinch‐off” syndrome is far more common.4\\n\\n\\nBecause of the small number of thoracic extravasation injuries, there is no consensus on the most appropriate treatment, which is extrapolated from experience with peripheral access.5 Surgical procedures with the objective of draining the remaining solution after discontinuation of the infusion, along with dexrazoxane, must be considered as soon as possible to prevent major complications.\\n\\nSurgical options, such as percutaneous drainage, thoracoscopy, and open thoracotomy can be used. Unfortunately, the percutaneous option can cause subsequent complications because of the visual limitations of insertion, as in a case reported by Uges et al. where the percutaneous drainage was complicated by empyema.6\\n\\n\\nIn our case, we decided to use video‐assisted thoracoscopy to confirm the catheter position and to further assess the local tissue damage from doxorubicin. It also guided an accurate lavage of the cavity, the placement of the catheters that were used posteriorly for continuous irrigation, and helped to safely remove the mal‐positioned catheter (Fig 2).\\n\\nIn conclusion, combined early medical and surgical management of pleural extravasation of cytotoxic drugs, such as anthracyclines, is essential. Video‐assisted thoracoscopy can confirm tissue damage and aid drainage, lavage, and subsequent irrigation of the cavity.

Positron emission tomography-CT scans (Biograph™ TruePoint™ PET•CT; Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc., Knoxville, TN, USA) showed widespread metastases in the patient’s body on November 22, 2007 (Fig. 1).

The patient died of multiple organ failure in September 2009.\\n\\nDiscussion\\nFollowing ovarian cancer surgery, the patient exhibited disease-free survival for several years until the cancer recurred and a CT scan revealed widespread intra-abdominal metastases. The patient had concomitant diseases and developed massive ascites and pleural effusion. Treatment included IP chemotherapy and oral etoposide. These treatments were ineffective and the condition of the patient deteriorated further. To the best of our knowledge, no similar clinical case has been reported, and palliative care remains the recommended treatment for such cases (2,6).\\n\\nAscites disappear rapidly with bevacizumab treatment (7–9). In the present case study, massive effusion in the thoracic and abdominal cavity disappeared within a short time-frame subsequent to bevacizumab administration, thereby providing a basis for the next treatment. Bevacizumab was administered by IV infusion every two weeks and IP carboplatin was administered intermittently until the death of the patient. The patient was likely to have died earlier if pleural effusion had not been rapidly controlled; by contrast, the patient experienced disease-free survival for 25 months and treatment was associated with favorable results. Thus, bevacizumab may be concluded to play a key role in disease control.'], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: Epithelial ovarian cancer: A case report., context: ['Bevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin improves the progression-free survival of patients with ovarian cancer; however, it does not increase their overall survival time. Furthermore, the use of the drug in maintenance therapy subsequent to chemotherapy does not appear to increase overall survival (5). Other studies have indicated that bevacizumab does not increase overall survival in any cancer type, despite its ability to prolong progression-free survival (10–12). Thus, it was concluded that no overall survival benefit may be derived from bevacizumab. However, chemotherapy is contraindicated for patients with massive ascites, massive pleural effusions, breathing difficulties and poor performance status. Continuing chemotherapy in such cases may aggravate the patient’s condition and possibly lead to death. In the present case study, the patient’s ascites and pleural effusion disappeared following administration of bevacizumab, and a significant improvement in performance status was observed. IP chemotherapy combined with bevacizumab also led to extended disease-free survival. Thus, the role of bevacizumab in prolonging survival in patients with ovarian cancer warrants further study. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure of the patient rose continually until her death; such increases in arterial pressure may be associated with the use of bevacizumab.\\n\\nChemotherapy regimens for platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer include monotherapy with agents such as cisplatin and carboplatin, as well as combination therapies, including paclitaxel plus carboplatin, carboplatin plus gemcitabine and cisplatin plus gemcitabine (13–16). Other regimens may also be effective, including monotherapy with paclitaxel, docetaxel, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, oxaliplatin, melphalan, irinotecan, capecitabine, pemetrexed and etoposide, and hormone therapy with tamoxifen, anastrozole, letrozole, leuprorelin acetate and megestrol acetate (16–18). In the present case study, the patient received goserelin acetate implant, etoposide and megestrol acetate; however, these treatments were not efficacious. IP carboplatin was beneficial until the patient was no longer able to tolerate the treatment. Carboplatin was prescribed as it has a lower impact on the kidney than other drugs. This treatment strategy had a favorable outcome for the patient.\\n\\nBevacizumab rapidly eliminated the massive ascites and pleural effusion and achieved an effect that was not able to be attained with other treatments. Bevacizumab appears to be an effective means of controlling late-stage relapse and refractory ovarian cancer.

      "Predicting with title: The tacrolimus metabolism rate influences renal function after kidney transplantation., context: [\"The effective calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) tacrolimus (Tac) is an integral part of the standard immunosuppressive regimen after renal transplantation (RTx). However, as a potent CNI it has nephrotoxic potential leading to impaired renal function in some cases. Therefore, it is of high clinical impact to identify factors which can predict who is endangered to develop CNI toxicity. We hypothesized that the Tac metabolism rate expressed as the blood concentration normalized by the dose (C/D ratio) is such a simple predictor. Therefore, we analyzed the impact of the C/D ratio on kidney function after RTx. Renal function was analyzed 1, 2, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after RTx in 248 patients with an immunosuppressive regimen including basiliximab, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and prednisolone. According to keep the approach simple, patients were split into three C/D groups: fast, intermediate and slow metabolizers. Notably, compared with slow metabolizers fast metabolizers of Tac showed significantly lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) values at all the time points analyzed. Moreover, fast metabolizers underwent more indication renal biopsies (p\\u200a=\\u200a0.006) which revealed a higher incidence of CNI nephrotoxicity (p\\u200a=\\u200a0.015) and BK nephropathy (p\\u200a=\\u200a0.024) in this group. We herein identified the C/D ratio as an easy calculable risk factor for the development of CNI nephrotoxicity and BK nephropathy after RTx. We propose that the simple C/D ratio should be taken into account early in patient's risk management strategies.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nThe calcineurin-inhibitor (CNI) tacrolimus (Tac) is one of the most effective immunosuppressive drugs used for renal transplantation (RTx). In combination with mycophenolate mofetil, prednisolone and daclizumab, Tac regimen showed a superior graft function, better prevention of acute rejection and superior graft survival after 12 months compared to cyclosporine A and sirolimus [1].\\n\\nUnfortunately, Tac has a narrow therapeutic window. It can lead to acute as well as to chronic nephrotoxicity. Acute Tac nephrotoxicity due to high Tac levels typically presents early after RTx as e.g. isometric vacuolizations of tubular cells. In fact, even as early as one month after RTx, glomerulosclerosis in renal allografts can be associated to CNI nephrotoxicity. Typical chronic CNI-related allograft changes include tubule-interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy (IF/TA), tubular microcalcifications, glomerulosclerosis and artheriolar hyalinosis. Acute tubular damage can be reversed within the first three months after RTx, however, chronic lesions observed after the third month are usually progressive ones [2]–[4].\"], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: The tacrolimus metabolism rate influences renal function after kidney transplantation., context: ['Although there seems to be a strong association between higher CNI trough levels and nephrotoxicity [5], nephrotoxic effects of Tac can occur even at prescribed low-level regimens (4–6 ng/mL) [6]. In that context it is important that Tac metabolism depends on individual factors - clinical and genetic ones. Clinical variables like haematocrit, serum albumin, age, gender, body mass index (BMI) or absorption have been proposed to be significant influencing variables [7], [8]. However, some are still a matter of debate. The most relevant genes encode the cytochrome-P450 enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 leading to significant differences in Tac pharmacodynamics [9]. However, genetic profiling of patients is still far from been a routine test and the dosage needed to reach target Tac level varies in patients with known CYP3A polymorphisms over the time [10]. Of higher clinical relevance is that physicians have to take interactions influencing Tac metabolism into account when prescribing new drugs. In the transplant setting interactions with other immunosuppressive drugs, such as corticosteroids, sirolimus and everolimus are considered in daily routine. Nevertheless, the clinical relevance of these interactions remains widely unclear [11]. Yet another unanswered question of interest is, if the presence of CYP3A5 in the apical tubular plasma membrane observed in kidneys with CNI nephrotoxicity is causally relevant or not [12], [13].\\n\\nTherefore, factors which can predict patients’ risk to develop Tac side effects or promote clinically reasonable handling of Tac are of high interest to transplant surgeons and nephrologists.\\n\\nWe hypothesize that the Tac metabolism rate expressed as the simple blood concentration normalized by the dose (C/D ratio) is such a predictor.\\n\\nMaterials and Methods\\nStudy population and clinical data\\nWe analyzed data from 311 patients who underwent RTx between January 2007 and March 2012.

An induction therapy with basiliximab (Simulect) was given at day 0 and 4. Tac was started at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg bid with a target trough level of 7–12 ng/mL during the first month, 6–10 ng/mL from month 2 to 3 and 3–8 ng/mL for the following time. 1 g mycophenolate mofetil bid was administered and adapted in case of adverse events like leukopenia, diarrhea and infections. Prednisolone was started with 250 mg intravenous (i.v.) before and directly after transplantation, following 3 days of 100 mg i.v. per day. Then prednisolone was reduced by 20 mg per day. 20 mg/day was kept until the end of the first month.

Blood tests at that time (as indicated in Figure 1, day 23), showed undetectable HCV viral load, with new elevations of liver enzymes and she was advised to increase oral hydration for symptomatic relief. One week later (day 30), she presented to emergency room with complaints of profound weakness and myalgia along with ongoing nausea and abdominal pain. On physical examination, she appeared slightly dry, with slight periumbilical tenderness and without ascites. She demonstrated diffuse muscle weakness and muscle tenderness in all extremities. No focal neurologic deficit was identified. The admission labs (as noted in Table 1 and Figure 1, day 30) were noticeable for elevated liver enzymes, creatinine, and creatine phosphokinase (CPK). Urinalysis showed large amount of blood, without RBCs. Clinical diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis was made. Her atorvastatin was stopped and she was aggressively fluid resuscitated. CPK levels subsequently trended down and renal function returned to baseline. The workup for myalgia was unremarkable, with normal aldolase, C3 and C4 complement levels, TSH, and serum protein electrophoresis. Neurology evaluation was done, and EMG was done to evaluate for profound muscular weakness. EMG showed diffuse muscle irritability with no evidence of polyneuropathy, suggesting this patient had an inflammatory myopathy.\\n\\nRhabdomyolysis was considered likely from an interaction between Sof/Led, atorvastatin, and colchicine in the background of abnormal renal function. The rise of AST/ALT was considered to be from her rhabdomyolysis (nonhepatic). Colchicine was also stopped and she was continued on Sof/Led and low dose ribavirin with daily monitoring of her labs. By the time of discharge, her rhabdomyolysis resolved, with return of baseline GFR of 43\\u2009mL/min/1.73\\u2009m2.

In addition, the Sof/Led label does not mention many drug interactions; however both components are P-gp substrates [4]. Led is an inhibitor of the drug transporters P-gp and Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) and may increase intestinal absorption of coadministered substrates for these transporters [5]. Sof/Led is not recommended to be given with other known P-gp-inducers due to the potential for decrease in efficacy. Led can increase absorption of colchicine by P-gp inhibition and of rosuvastatin via inhibition of BCRP. Coadministration of Sof/Led with rosuvastatin can potentially increase the risk of statin related myopathy and rhabdomyolysis [6]. Sof accumulation in renal failure can also lead to toxicity and the patient should be closely monitored for liver failure if Sof is to be used in these patients. Additionally, colchicine has the independent ability to cause myotoxicity [7]. Sof/Led has not been noted to interact adversely with atorvastatin; however, a theoretical interaction exists via P-gp inhibition by atorvastatin, causing an increased level of led. Atorvastatin can itself increase levels of colchicine due to P-gp inhibition. Using colchicine in combination with a statin has been reported to cause myotoxicity, especially in the setting of CKD [8]. Atorvastatin 80\\u2009mg was used in this patient as it was used for secondary prevention for her coronary artery disease. A lower dose of atorvastatin was not attempted as the patient was symptomatic from her rhabdomyolysis and the patient was not having any active coronary artery disease.\\n\\nIn our patient, the addition of the Led in the presence of atorvastatin could have further increased the levels of colchicine, increasing the likelihood of muscle toxicity and causing rhabdomyolysis. Colchicine is renally eliminated and requires dose adjustments based on renal dysfunction. Thus, this patient's stage III CKD combined with a high colchicine dose and P-gp mediated drug interactions could have played a critical role in increasing the chance of this unanticipated toxicity [8]. There was little concern for mitochondrial toxicity caused by a lactic acidosis as the patient has a normal anion gap and normal lactate levels.\\n\\nThe Naranjo probability score [9] was developed to help assess causality for adverse drug reactions and based on score of 6 (Table 2) this patient's adverse event correlates with a probable adverse drug reaction. Although atorvastatin levels were directly measured, the muscle toxicity described was likely attributed to drug interactions in combination with preexisting renal impairment. Sof/Led was coadministered with two drugs known to cause myositis. Drug interactions, via P-gp inhibition, caused increased levels of all drugs, potentially increasing the risk of muscle problem development. It is important for physicians' prescribing Sof/Led to be aware of the potential drug interactions.\"], hint: None\n",

In addition, colchicine should be stopped, as there are other treatments for an acute gout flare (such as prednisone) that do not have a drug-drug interaction with atorvastatin and Sof/Led in causing rhabdomyolysis.

However, nicotine as a drug, and its effects on human psychology are largely under-investigated in genetic studies. In this study, we recruited 208 current non-smokers to evaluate the effect of nicotine and its relationship to genetic risks to nicotine dependence. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, as well as measurement invariance testing, were conducted to evaluate the latent factor structures of the POMS, PANAS and DEN questionnaires across 3 nicotine doses. Structural models were used to examine the effects of nicotine and their relationship to genetic risks of nicotine dependence. We found that nicotine administration led to the change of both measurement construct and factor means, indicating the causal effect of nicotine on the psychological responses. The genotypes of rs588765 predicted the scores of the DEN Confused and Dizzy factors (p = 0.0003 and 0.001 respectively), and rs16969968 and rs588765 were associated with the PANAS Nervous factor (p = 0.006 and 0.007 respectively). Our study suggested that genetic risk of nicotine dependence is associated with acute psychological responses. The integration of psychometric analyses and dose effects could be a powerful approach for genetic study of nicotine dependence.\\n\\nIn the last several years, genetic studies of smoking and nicotine dependence have made significant progress, exemplified by the identification of the CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4 locus.

This locus includes the CHRNA5, CHRNA3 and CHRNB4 genes. While a non-synonymous SNP, rs16969968, in the CHRNA5 gene has emerged as a functional candidate, it may not be the one tagging the strongest association signal12.

      "Predicting with title: Genetic risks to nicotine dependence predict negative mood and affect in current non-smokers., context: ['Nicotine, the primary psychoactive substance in cigarette smoke, has broad psychological effects on humans14. When first exposed to nicotine, either by smoking or other routes of administration, some people feel pleasant and relaxed, while others feel dizzy and nauseous. These initial responses to nicotine have significant impacts on sustained smoking and subsequent development of nicotine dependence15161718. However, in a typical genetic study, the psychological effects of nicotine are rarely utilized and included in association testing. This omission is due, in part, to the fact that little is known of the relationship between these effects and genetic risks of nicotine dependence. In the literature, there are a few reports on the association between subjective measures and genetic variants in the nicotinic receptors, and some nominal associations are found in the CHRNB3/CHRNA619 and CHRNB220 genes. These studies use the scores of individual items or several items that contribute to a common factor, but these studies do not control for measurement errors and correlations between items, and do not have nicotine dose effect information.\\n\\nPsychometric analysis with structural equation modeling provides a framework for constructing latent factor structures that can take into account measurement errors, item residual correlations and the degree of invariance across multiple waves of data simultaneously. In theory, it can identify and differentiate “true” treatment responses from confounding effects, attribute responses directly to experimental treatments (nicotine administration and dosage), and permit the test of genetic effects on these responses. Thus, integration of structural modeling with association testing may improve statistical power when well targeted hypotheses are postulated. To demonstrate the utility and advantage of this approach, we conducted a pilot study to evaluate the relationship between genetic risks of nicotine dependence and the subjective responses resulting from nicotine administration. We hypothesized that genetic risks of nicotine dependence contributed to subjective responses, and that by integrating psychometric modeling of psychological effects and dose effects we could improve statistical power to detect this genetic association. In a lab setting, we recruited 208 non-smokers, and measured their psychological responses via self-report by the Profile of Mood State (POMS)21, the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS)22, and the Direct Effects of Nicotine scale (DEN)23 after administration of each of a series of nicotine doses.

Towards these goals, we needed first to examine the latent factor structures of the items of the instruments, and to evaluate whether the latent measurement factor structures remained equivalent (i.e. statistically invariant) after the administration of different nicotine doses using measurement invariance (MI) testing procedures. A failure in the MI testing would provide evidence that the latent factor(s) and the individual differences they represent were not constructed equivalently across the nicotine administrations, i.e., individual differences on the latent factors were not calibrated in the same way across administrations, presumably due to differential item responses attributable to the administration of different amounts of nicotine.

His vision was recorded as having no light perception. The RAPD was found to be 4+. The fundus was examined under full pupillary dilation. The retina appeared normal, and the optic disc was not edematous. In the afternoon, the patient's visual acuity (VA) was improved to 3-m count-finger. On the second postoperative morning, the patient's VA was improved to 4/10. Vision assessment on the early morning of the third postoperative day was surprising. The patient's VA had improved to 20/20 without RAPD, and all other ocular examinations were normal.\\n\\nDiscussion\\nThe preferred technique for cataract surgeons in the United States is topical anesthesia (37%; range 22–63%). In a survey conducted by David Learning,1 76% of respondents preferred using topical anesthesia with intracameral lidocaine injection. Intracameral unpreserved lidocaine augments analgesia and significantly decreases intraoperative pain perception. Lidocaine is a useful adjunct, particularly in cases involving pupillary manipulation and peripheral iridectomy.\\n\\nWhile lidocaine has been reported to be safe and effective,2, 3 temporary visual loss4, 5, 6 and retinal toxicity4, 6 following the use of intracameral lidocaine have been highlighted in recent reports. An increased possibility of adverse effects of lidocaine on the retina and optic nerve is introduced in the event of compromise to the posterior lens capsule.4\\n\\nOur patient had experienced transient visual loss while receiving intracameral lidocaine and had an associated posterior capsule rupture, which has an incidence of between 26% and 36% in posterior polar cataract surgeries.7, 8 Normally, during cataract surgery, the lens capsule, zonules, and vitreous humor have a barrier effect against instilled intracameral lidocaine, and hence, the retina will not be affected. Pars plana lensectomy and vitrectomy facilitate the diffusion of the lidocaine into the posterior chamber.4\\n\\nGills et\\xa0al.9 reported amaurosis in four patients following the use of intracameral lidocaine, and in each case, the posterior capsule was not intact. All four patients recovered completely within hours. Hoffman and Fine4 reported on a patient with complete visual loss after intracameral lidocaine to repair a traumatic corneal graft dehiscence with a capsular tear, which was fully recovered several hours postoperatively. Falzon et\\xa0al.10 reported a case of transient, complete loss of vision following phacoemulsification with an intracameral ophthalmic viscosurgical device (OVD) and lidocaine solution complicated by posterior capsule rupture, which improved to 20/80 after one day and 20/25 in one week.\\n\\nFull recovery of visual acuity in our patient required three days, in contrast to the majority of reports (Table 1) with capsular tear4, 9 that had complete VA improvements within hours. The longer time span in recovery of VA in our patient might be explained by a higher volume of lidocaine that was diffused in the vitreous.\"], hint: None\n",

This inhibition is probably due to an anesthetic-induced disruption of intercellular ionic balance and increased plasma membrane permeability. Furthermore, intravitreal injection of lidocaine has also been investigated in cats, rabbits, and rats.6, 12, 13 In these animal studies, the electroretinogram analyses revealed a reversible reduction in the amplitude and extinguished b-waves which fully recovered within 10–24\\xa0h. In cats, intravitreal injection of lidocaine has been followed with vacuolization of nerve layers and presence of microscopic lesions in synapses between horizontal, bipolar cells, and photoreceptors. In addition, histopathological retinal structure changes near the injection sites have been detected.\\n\\nOne limitation of our study is that the patient did not consent to perform the ERG and mfERG tests. However, in the presence of positive RAPD, normal retinal examination, and full recovery of vision, the most plausible cause of vision loss would be attributed to lidocaine retinal toxicity. In view of the above, when posterior capsular rupture occurs, it is wise not to repeat intracameral lidocaine to minimize potential retinal toxicity risks.\\n\\nFunding\\nThe authors did not receive any financial support from any public or private sources.

The safe upper limit for daily dosing has variably been thought to be 4000 mg/day or possibly less.2 Excessive APAP dosing can occur with intent of self-harm (suicide attempt) or unintentionally while seeking pain relief, typically for a period of several days by using increased amounts each day.3, 4 Early on, an association was made between alcohol abuse and APAP unintentional overdoses, referred to initially as therapeutic misadventure.5 Both intentional and unintentional APAP overdoses have been shown to be associated with substance abuse of both alcohol and opioids, particularly the opioid (hydrocodone/acetaminophen) combination products.6 In 1 study of 275 APAP-related ALF patients, 55% had a history of alcohol use and 35% a history of alcohol abuse, and 53% had taken an opioid-APAP combination product.4 In a follow-up study of a larger cohort of 306 APAP toxicity survivors, 55% had a history of psychiatric disease compared with only 27% of non-APAP survivors, 46% of APAP patients had a history of prior substance abuse vs 15% of non-APAP patients, and 14% had a specific history of injection drug use vs 8% for the non-APAP group.7 Understanding what determines these behaviors might lead to better identification of high-risk patients and development of prevention strategies.\\n\\nWith either intentional or unintentional etiologies, critical behavioral differences could lead to high-risk behaviors. Impulsivity is a character trait defined as “acting suddenly in an unplanned manner to satisfy a desire,” ie, not thinking things through to understand the potential impact of a decision. More recently, impulsivity has been recognized as a measurable trait that is correlated with a variety of addictive behaviors.8 We have recently shown that higher impulsivity scores on the Barratt impulsivity scale are detected in both intentional and unintentional APAP overdoses when compared with control populations (Sanders C, Lee WM, unpublished data, submitted for publication).'], hint: None\n",

We hypothesized that this polymorphism or others that are related may have an impact in patients with APAP overdoses, especially in patients who have multiple substance dependencies. Furthermore, we speculated that the genetic association may be stronger or more apparent in subjects with intentional APAP overdose compared with those with nonintentional overdose. Thus, variations in several of these genes that alter the host’s ability to respond to stressful situations may indeed correlate with the observed tendency of addictive behavior.\\n\\nThe Acute Liver Failure Study Group (ALFSG) (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00518440) has been prospectively identifying and studying the etiologies, presenting features, and clinical outcomes of adults with ALF during the past 17 years while collecting biosamples—serum, plasma, and DNA. During this time period, ALFSG has enrolled more than 3000 subjects in its registry, 46% of whom suffered from severe or fatal APAP liver injury. Because stress and the response to stress are closely linked to addictive behavior and APAP toxicity patients have frequently been identified as substance abusers, we sought to determine whether specific variants in stress-related genes are over-represented in an APAP overdose cohort compared with population controls. By using DNA from 229 of these APAP subjects, we sought to identify whether selective variants in genes related to stress/impulsivity and addiction are associated with APAP overdose cases, because these findings might shed light on the patients’ tendency to abuse APAP products.\\n\\nMethods\\nPatients'], hint: None\n",

Here, we briefly introduce the case of a patient with latent autoimmune diabetes who developed SPS through the action of subcutaneously injected insulin. A 43-year-old man was diagnosed with diabetes and initially well-controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents but progressed to requiring insulin within 1 year of diagnosis. Two months after the initiation of basal insulin therapy, he presented with abdominal stiffness and painful muscle spasms, involving the lower limbs, which resulted in walking difficulty, and thus, he refused insulin injections thereafter. He had been treated with oral anti-diabetic agents instead of insulin for 10 years until premixed insulin twice daily was started again due to poor diabetes control. Immediately after insulin injection, abdominal muscle rigidity and spasms were noted. When insulin was not administered, frequent episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis occurred. Serum GAD antibody test was positive and there was no positivity for islet antigen-2 antibody. A glucagon stimulation test demonstrated relative insulin deficiency, indicative of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA).

      "Predicting with title: Exogenous Insulin Injection-Induced Stiff-Person Syndrome in a Patient With Latent Autoimmune Diabetes: A Case Report and Literature Review., context: ['Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a rare autoimmune neurological disorder and highly associated with glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody (GAD-Ab) positivity. Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the predominant inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. In the neuron, GABA is synthesized in the cytosol from its precursor glutamate by the enzyme glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) and then transported into the synaptic vesicles (1–3). The blockade of GAD, a critical enzyme involved in inhibitory pathways, and subsequent decline in the levels of GABA in the central nervous system have been suggested to be associated with a loss of neural inhibition, although evidence for a causative link between GAD antibodies and SPS pathogenesis is still lacking (1). GAD is the rate-limiting enzyme for the synthesis of GABA. SPS is characterized by progressive muscle stiffness, rigidity, and spasm involving the truncal and proximal limb muscles, resulting in severely impaired ambulation (4). It is suspected that the symptoms of SPS get precipitated by external stimuli, such as sounds, stress, and emotional upheaval (1, 5). The diagnosis of SPS is based on the detection of typical clinical findings, GAD antibody positivity, and suggestive ancillary investigations. GAD is also found in non-neuronal tissues, such as pancreatic beta cells, testes, and oviducts, so SPS is also associated with other endocrine disorders (6, 7). It has been shown that ~45% of patients with SPS have type 1 diabetes (T1D), which is an autoimmune disease characterized by the immune-mediated loss of the insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells (1, 5, 8, 9). SPS and T1D share human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genetic risk, with most SPS patients possessing the DQ2 phenotype (10). Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) shares clinical and metabolic characteristics with both T1D and type 2 diabetes (T2D). According to the criteria of LADA diagnosis, LADA is defined by the absence of insulin requirement for at least 6 months after diagnosis and exhibits an older age of onset, as well as a slower progression toward insulin dependence compared to subjects with T1D (11, 12). LADA in SPS is rarely described (13). Here, we reported a case of SPS in a patient with LADA. To our knowledge, this is the first report of SPS described shortly after the initiation of insulin therapy that required to split the administration of basal insulin into two separate injections (with lower amounts of insulin units per each injection) to achieve tolerable muscle symptoms and better glucose control, without the development of diabetic ketoacidosis.\\n\\nCase Report'], hint: None\n",

However, within 1 year, he was started on subcutaneous insulin injections (Insulatard, isophane Neutral Protamine Hagedorn human insulin, twice daily). Two months after the initiation of insulin therapy, he presented with abdominal stiffness, painful spasms extending to lower limbs, and impaired walking ability. Neurological examination showed muscle rigidity and bilateral contractures in the lower limbs but no muscular weakness. Electroencephalography was normal, and electromyography/nerve conduction velocity revealed slightly asymmetrical motor and sensory polyneuropathy with demyelination. These features were highly indicative of SPS. Therefore, diazepam (10 mg/day in two divided oral doses), clonazepam (2 mg orally four times daily), baclofen (10 mg two times daily), and phenobarbital (30 mg two times daily) were administered to treat muscle rigidity.\\n\\nThe patient's symptoms of jerky myoclonus-like movement, abdominal stiffness with painful spasms, and muscle rigidity were exacerbated by sound, anxiety, and subcutaneous insulin injections, regardless of the treatment regimen (Insulatard or regular insulin). Thus, he refused insulin therapy, resulting in poor glycemic control for 10 years, which resulted in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values persistently >8.0% (64 mmol/mol) with only oral anti-diabetic drugs (metformin 2,000 mg/day, sitagliptin 100 mg/day, glimepiride 8 mg/day, and acarbose 200 mg/day). Therefore, basal insulin (insulin glargine, 0.43 IU/Kg/day) with oral anti-diabetic agents (metformin 1,500 mg/day and gliclazide MR 240 mg/day) followed by premixed insulin twice daily (Humalog Mix 25, 0.71 IU/Kg/day) or a basal-bolus injection regimen (insulin detemir 0.17 IU/Kg/day and insulin aspart 0.13 IU/Kg/day) were introduced since 2015. He consistently experienced muscle rigidity with subcutaneous insulin injections every time. His fear and anxiety of re-experiencing muscle stiffness resulted in poor compliance with the prescribed therapeutic regimens. Finally, he experienced two episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis in 2017 (BMI was 22.45 kg/m2) and the laboratory results are summarized in Table 1.

The presence of high-titers of GAD autoantibodies has been reported in more than 85% of patients with SPS (1, 14, 15). GAD is involved in the synthesis of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma aminobutyric acid in the central nervous system (CNS). Dysfunction of GABA input in motor neurons causes stiffness, rigidity, and painful spasms (16). GABAergic neuron dysfunction has also been reported in epilepsy, and 10% of patients with SPS have some form of epilepsy (1, 16). From preclinical and animal models, it has been hypothesized that autoimmune responses against GAD in pancreatic islet deplete this enzyme and reduce GABA levels within the GABAergic system in the endocrine pancreas, thus promoting the progression of T1D. Moreover, GABA has been shown to exert β-cell regenerative effects, protecting β-cells against apoptosis induced by cytokines, drugs, and other stresses, and exerting anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory effects (17). The GAD-Abs are believed to play a role in the possible relationship between epilepsy and T1D (18). Two major isoforms of GAD enzyme exist, namely GAD65, and GAD67, which catalyze the formation of GABA at different locations in the cell and different time periods of development. GAD65 is attached to the surface of synaptic vesicles in GABAergic neurons or microvesicles in the pancreatic beta-cells, while GAD67 is a soluble form detectable only in the CNS (19). Anti-GAD antibodies are detected in up to 80% of SPS patients, while antibodies against the GAD67 isoform occur in <50% of patients and at much lower levels (19, 20).'], hint: None\n",

The inflammation and the impaired oligodendrocyte function lead to neuronal dysfunction and precipitate cell death. The misfolded α-synuclein exhibits prion-like properties and can spread to other brain areas. Depending on the affected site the clinical presentation varies: striatonigral degeneration presents as parkinsonism with poor response to levodopa, olivopontocerebellar atrophy with cerebellar syndrome and degeneration of the brain stem and the medullary autonomic nuclei with failure of the autonomous system.\\n\\nIn our report, we describe a 55-year-old female MSA patient, presenting with a persistent febrile syndrome, who was diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).\\n\\n2 Case presentation\\nA 55-year-old female patient of Greek origin was admitted in our hospital due to a recurring febrile syndrome up to 39oC during the week before the admission for which the family physician had prescribed ciprofloxacin for presumptive urinary tract infection in the context of intermittent bladder catheterizations without resolution of the symptoms.\\n\\nThe patient was diagnosed with probable MSA with onset 2 years before presentation. Initially, urinary incontinence was attributed to genitourinary syndrome of menopause and due to failure to manage with medical treatment the patient resorted to intermittent bladder catheterization. Symptoms progressed with frequent falls and documentation of orthostatic hypotension and finally, parkinsonism. The disease was not responsive to levodopa treatment and a DaT scan was not consistent with Parkinson's disease.\\n\\nPatient history was also notable for asthma, hypothyroidism, depression, placental abruption, and endoscopic resection of multiple benign colon polyps.\\n\\nAt presentation the patient was unwell without any specific complaints and febrile with marked orthostatic hypotension and normal oxygen saturation. Clinical examination was unremarkable except for the neurological status where no modifications with respect to the patient's baseline were noted. The complete blood cell count on admission was notable for normocytic anemia with low reticulocyte count (Hemoglobin 9.8\\u200ag/dl). Renal function was normal and hypokalemia (K 2.9 mEq/l) as well as hyponatremia (Na 128 mEq/l) with low specific gravity as a surrogate for urine osmolality and low urine sodium (21 mEq/l) were documented.

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Non-Commercial, No Derivatives (CC BY-NC-ND) license.\\n\\nResistance to antipsychotic treatment is defined as failure to respond to two antipsychotics of adequate dose and duration1 and occurs in 30% of individuals with schizophrenia.2 Clozapine is the only medication with evidence-based effectiveness in treatment-resistant schizophrenia,1 being effective in 50–60% of cases,3 but is also associated with a broad range of adverse effects. A commonly accepted risk is clozapine-induced blood dyscrasia, typically neutropenia or agranulocytosis. Neutropenia is defined as a neutrophil count of less than 1.5×109/L, occurring at a rate of 2.7% of clozapine users at 1 year.4 Patients who develop neutropenia may develop flu-like symptoms such as sore throat and pyrexia, with the peak risk occurring at 6–18 weeks. Less common is agranulocytosis, a life-threatening event defined as a neutrophil count of less than 0.5×109/L, occurring in approximately 0.8% of clozapine users at 1 year.4\\n\\nDispensing of clozapine is dependent on a satisfactory full blood count (FBC) result and maintenance of normal white blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil counts during clozapine treatment. In established clozapine-induced neutropenia or agranulocytosis, clozapine is immediately discontinued, and given the increased risk of recurrence,5 re-challenge is contraindicated. However, re-challenge may be attempted under certain conditions, for example, due to an alternative cause of the reduced neutrophil count being identified, or after careful assessment of the clinical risks and benefits. This process involves collaboration with a haematologist and may involve the co-administration of lithium or granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCS-F) in an attempt to promote granulocyte proliferation and increase the WBC and neutrophil counts. Despite carefully controlled re-challenge, a third of patients will develop a further blood dyscrasia, which is often more rapid in onset and more severe.5\\n\\nIn this report, we add to the limited existing evidence of successfully re-challenging clozapine for a third time with a patient with treatment-resistant schizoaffective disorder, following two episodes of agranulocytosis and one of episode of neutropenia.\\n\\nCase report'], hint: None\n",

She was born and raised abroad before moving to the UK at the age of 21 years. J.B. first presented with psychotic symptoms at the age of 19 years. Over the next decade, she had multiple admissions to psychiatric hospitals, both informally and under Section 3 of the Mental Health Act. Her illness was characterised by mixed affective episodes associated with persecutory delusions, thought disorder and auditory hallucinations, often triggered by stress or periods of non-adherence to medication. During admission to our service, persecutory beliefs were about other patients, staff and visitors, and led to accusations of theft of her belongings, accusations of sexual assault and physical aggression. Periodically, she became suspicious about the side-effects of medications and declined to adhere to their administration. There was a significant labile component to her mood, fluctuating between laughing and verbal or physical aggression. Between episodes, J.B. was pleasant, engaged in recovery-oriented practices and appeared less preoccupied and distressed by positive psychotic symptoms.\\n\\nDuring the first 7 years of her illness, J.B. was treated with multiple antipsychotics (i.e. quetiapine, aripiprazole, risperidone, olanzapine, amisulpride, haloperidol, sulpiride, zuclopenthixol decanoate and flupentixol decanoate), mood stabilisers (lithium carbonate and sodium valproate) and a course of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) with minimal improvement documented in case notes.

At this time, she was also receiving quetiapine and sodium valproate. Pre-treatment FBC showed a WBC count of 5.8×109/L and a neutrophil count of 2.9×109/L. WBC and neutrophil counts remained within normal limits until week 17, when J.B. developed agranulocytosis with a nadir WBC count of 2.0×109/L and a neutrophil count of 0.41×109/L. The daily dose of clozapine was 300 mg, with a plasma clozapine concentration of 0.17 mg/dL. Clozapine was immediately stopped and olanzapine was commenced as an alternative. The blood dyscrasia persisted for 19 days in total before cell counts recovered. Case records from the previous hospital indicated a significant improvement in her clinical state with clozapine, and discontinuation was associated with a rapid increase in her psychotic symptoms.\\n\\nTrial 2\\nA second clozapine challenge was initiated in February 2012. Sodium valproate was discontinued prior to the second clozapine trial. At this time, J.B. was concurrently treated with olanzapine 10 mg and lithium carbonate 300 mg daily. An FBC prior to re-challenge with clozapine showed a WBC count of 8.0×109/L and a neutrophil count of 4.4×109/L.

Following consultation with a haematologist, J.B. continued clozapine treatment with an additional dose of filgrastim 480 mcg given that day. This resulted in a good response, with the neutrophil count increasing to 19.2×109/L and the WBC to 23.10×109/L the following day. A plan was formulated to increase the frequency of filgrastim injections to twice weekly in the event of further neutropenia; however, this was not required.

In October 2014, following specialist consultations, the multidisciplinary team agreed collaboratively with the patient and family to re-challenge with clozapine for a third time under close supervision. She was deemed to have capacity to be part of each of these decisions. Following consultation with a haematologist and pharmacist, lithium carbonate was commenced prior to clozapine initiation, and weekly FBCs were measured over the first year of clozapine treatment. It was planned that in the event of the neutrophil count dropping below 2×109/L, a single dose of 105 mcg of lenograstim was to be administered subcutaneously, and clozapine was to be continued with daily blood monitoring. In the event of the neutrophil count dropping below 1.5×109/L, a single dose of 105 mcg lenograstim was to be administered, and clozapine treatment immediately terminated. Lenograstim was to be used in preference to filgrastim because of increased experience with its use in our clinical setting.\\n\\nPre-treatment FBC demonstrated a WBC count of 8.43×109/L and a neutrophil count of 5.7×109/L. Standard clozapine titration was carried out as per Maudsley Guidelines,7 and clozapine was increased to a dose of 550 mg daily administered in liquid form. Lithium carbonate at 1200 mg daily was concurrently used, with serum lithium levels of 0.55–0.95 mmol/L attained. Weekly FBCs across the first year demonstrated stable WBC and neutrophil counts, with no episodes of neutropenia or the need for rescue lenograstim. Consistently, therapeutic plasma clozapine concentrations of around 0.35–0.40 mg/L were attained, without further haematological complications despite continuation of clozapine, and a dramatic improvement in mental state was observed.\\n\\nDiscussion\\nOwing to the severity and distressing nature of this young woman’s psychotic and mood symptoms and the lack of response to a number of antipsychotic medications, clozapine was re-challenged following specialist consultations and close monitoring practices. The results were promising given the failure of three previous attempts and thus support the need for measured re-challenging and augmentation practices. In a recent systematic review, clozapine re-challenge was successful in 70% (78/112 patients) after an episode of neutropenia, with 20% (3/15 patients) successfully re-challenged after agranulocytosis.8 The co-administration of lithium (33/35 patients) or GCS-F (7/11 patients), in a targeted strategy, decreased the likelihood of developing a further blood dyscrasia.8 We reported previously that a clozapine re-challenge was successful in 79% of patients (n=19) admitted to our service.9'], hint: None\n",

The first trial of clozapine was concurrent with the use of sodium valproate. Sodium valproate can cause a dose-dependent inhibition of granulopoiesis,11 which when combined with clozapine may have led to the agranulocytosis. In the second trial, clozapine re-challenge occurred in combination with lithium carbonate. Lithium carbonate has demonstrated the ability to increase circulating neutrophils and granulocyte colony formation.12–14 Although a neutropenia occurred during this trial, it is interesting to note that the neutrophil count did not drop as low as seen in the first trial. During the third trial, J.B. was treated with concurrent G-CSF, and although agranulocytosis still occurred, neutrophil recovery was 1 day, which was significantly shorter than the recovery seen in the first and second trials. We are unable to explain this transient episode of agranulocytosis and the lack of any recurrent neutropenia over the following 7 months of clozapine treatment with concurrent G-CSF (with no G-CSF dose change). We cannot exclude that a transient increase in plasma clozapine concentrations was related to the onset of agranulocytosis (we have no data relating to plasma clozapine concentrations at that time, nor do we know if the patient had ceased smoking at or around this time). Alternatively, the presence of a viral infection may have contributed to the onset of agranulocytosis, though this was not clinically documented.\\n\\nDuring the fourth trial, lithium carbonate was used with therapeutic serum levels attained. Previous work has suggested that serum lithium levels greater than 0.4 mmol/L are required for granulopoiesis.14 Given the low dose of lithium carbonate used during the second trial, it may be that there were insufficient lithium levels to promote granulocyte colony formation at that time and that the optimal serum lithium levels in the fourth trial supported the maintenance of normal neutrophil counts.\\n\\nDespite neutropenia and agranulocytosis being well-documented complications of clozapine treatment, the mechanism of action remains unclear.15 There are several hypotheses, but due to its idiosyncratic nature it has been difficult to perform mechanistic studies to investigate these in a systematic fashion. Clozapine-induced agranulocytosis (CIA) has a large genetic component; genetic data suggest dysfunction in the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) system, which comprises genes that modulate immune system function. Recent work has suggested that there is an association with several genetic variants in the HLA-DQB1 locus, a single amino acid at HLA-DQB1 (126Q) and an amino acid change in the extracellular binding pocket of HLA-B (158T).16'], hint: None\n",

The immunosuppressive regimen included basiliximab induction and belatacept/mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)/corticosteroid maintenance. Belatacept was used because the kidney came from an extended-criteria donor [4]. Belatacept was administered intravenously, as recommended for the less intensive regimen (10 mg/kg on day 1 (D1), D5, week 2 (W2), W4, W8, W12; then beyond the third month, 5 mg/kg per month) [4]. During the posttransplantation period, the patient experienced multiple complications of viral reactivation, including cytomegalovirus disease at 7 months treated with valganciclovir; BK virus (BKV) reactivation at month 9 without polyomavirus-associated nephropathy on biopsy leading to a reduction in the MMF dosage (500 mg twice a day); and Epstein-Barr virus viremia at month 16 with no signs of a posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder. Fourteen months after transplantation, he received pulsed intravenous corticosteroids for cellular rejection (grade Ib). The estimated glomerular filtration rate stabilized at 53 mL/min per 1.73 m2 (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula).

His family described mood disorders and confusion, which had started the month before. He developed progressive right-sided hemiparesis with temporospatial disorientation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed left frontoparietal subcortical white-matter lesions, without gadolinium enhancement, suggesting no vascular disease occurrence. These lesions were consistent with demyelination and suggested PML (Figure 1A). Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy was confirmed by the presence of JCV deoxyribonucleic acid in cerebrospinal fluid ([CSF] 7.15 × 103 copies/mL) ( Figure 1A). At PML diagnosis, he had lymphopenia (421 CD3 cells/µL), with 276 CD4 cells/µL and 145 CD8 cells/µL (Figure 1A). He was HIV seronegative. Mycophenolate mofetil was stopped when PML was confirmed.

As controls, we used 3 healthy donors who were responsive to JCV. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were incubated overnight with a pool of JCV peptides spanning the entire VP1 and VP2 regions that activate both CD4 and CD8 T-cells [5]. Cells were stained for surface markers and then fixed and permeabilized before being incubated with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. As shown in Figure 1B, TNF-α secretion was severely impaired at PML onset.\\n\\nWe tested the ability of CD4 and CD8 T cells to proliferate in response to JCV peptides. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stained with 0.5 µM carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester and then incubated for 5 days with JCV peptides. Specific T-cell proliferation was very weak (Figure 1C). To measure JCV-speciﬁc cytotoxicity, PBMCs were coincubated overnight with JCV peptide-coated autologous target cells. As control, cells were coincubated with uncoated autologous target cells. The mortality rate of target cells was evaluated by 7-amino-actinomycin D staining. No specific cytotoxicity was observed in the presence of JCV-specific peptides (Figure 1D). Despite the patient’s treatment, his T-cell responses to JCV remained weak throughout follow-up with no significant change (Figure 1B–D). We also assessed the expression of the inhibitory receptor programmed death-1 (PD-1). We found that the patient’s T cells expressed high levels of PD-1 up to day 61 (1 week before death) both ex vivo and after in vitro activation (Figure 2A). We then examined the effects of a neutralizing anti-PD-1 antibody (nivolumab) on T-cell proliferation in vitro. Programmed death-1 blockade failed to reverse this T-cell anergy (Figure 2B). Of interest, we tested in parallel a transplant recipient patient who had been receiving tacrolimus, MMF, and corticoids since November 2014. This patient developed BKV nephropathy along with BKV viremia (8.4 × 106 copies/mL) and was treated by replacing tacrolimus with everolimus (an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin) in April 2015. T lymphocytes from this patient were nonresponsive to BKV in vitro (Figure 2B) and expressed significant levels of PD-1 after BKV peptide activation (Figure 2A).

Interleukin-7 induces widespread T-cell proliferation, increased T-cell numbers, and a more diverse T-cell receptor repertoire. We recently reported the case of a PML patient with profound lymphopenia after allogenic bone marrow transplantation, in whom r-hIL-7 led to the recovery of effective polyfunctional JCV-specific T-cell responses, virus clearance from CSF, and a favorable clinical outcome [7]. In this study, r-hIL-7 had no significant effect on the CD4 and CD8 T-cell counts. The subsequent CD4 cell recovery would be due more to MMF withdrawal. However, the CD8 T-cell count remained low. The patient had been on belatacept for 20 months, resulting in a long-term lack of CD28-mediated costimulation. Belatacept, which can provide significantly better renal function and both patient and renal graft survival than calcineurin inhibitor-based immunosuppression [8], provokes T-cell anergy in vivo [9]. The CD4 T-cell count recovery observed in our patient was not associated with improved functionality in terms of cytokine secretion, proliferation, or cytotoxicity. These functional abnormalities persisted for 60 days after PML diagnosis (the patient died 69 days after PML diagnosis) and were associated with strong expression of the inhibitory receptor PD-1. However, treatment with a therapeutic anti-PD1 receptor antibody (nivolumab) ex vivo failed to improve T-cell function.'], hint: None\n",

Although mucosal bleeding is the most common, fatal bleeding complications are also possible. Thus, F5D increases the difficulty of invasive testing, and surgical and procedural treatments. When long-term antithrombotic drugs, including antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants, are required in patients at high risk of bleeding, one of the biggest challenges is coronary intervention to treat coronary artery disease. Most studies recommend preinterventional or preoperative supplementation with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to reduce bleeding risk.[2,3] However, in addition to the bleeding risk caused by antithrombotic therapy, the hypercoagulable state in coronary intervention has an adverse effect on stent thrombosis, mortality, and prognosis during the postinterventional period.[4] The contemporary standard therapy for significant coronary artery stenosis is implanting a drug-eluting stent (DES). However, because implanting a DES delays endothelial healing and requires long-term antithrombotic therapy, DES implantation in an F5D patient is very complex. No antithrombotic therapy study to date has been reported for F5D patients undergoing coronary stenting.

She was not taking any medication except hypnotics, and her only cardiovascular risk factor was old age. Although she had had 3 natural childbirths, she had no history of surgery or blood transfusions. No specific findings were observed upon physical examination, electrocardiography (ECG), or chest x-ray imaging, and cardiac biomarkers were within the normal range, but the D-dimer, prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and activated PTT levels were prolonged. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a normal left ventricular ejection fraction and no regional wall motion abnormality.

FFP or platelet transfusion is recommended to control bleeding. In particular, transfusing FFP is recommended to maintain factor V activity at >25% to 30% in cases of bleeding, invasive testing, or surgery.[3,6] In this case, FFP was not transfused because coronary stenting was performed without knowledge of the degree of factor V activity or the existence of F5D. We recognized F5D due to hemoptysis, epistaxis, and hematochezia after coronary stenting. However, we first planned to reduce or modify the dosage of antithrombotic drugs due to the risk of stent thrombosis. This strategy was based on previous reports in which factor V activity was not related to bleeding severity.[2,6] Moreover, successful childbirth delivery was possible without an FFP transfusion, and the success rate for bleeding control was low with FFP transfusion.[3,6] Fortunately, mucosal bleeding in the present case was controlled by adjusting the antithrombotic drug dose. Treatments for the inhibitors or antibodies to factor V are another option and include plasmapheresis, immunosuppressants, steroids, intravenous globulins, and a monoclonal antibody.[2] Such therapies were not used in our case because the inhibitors and autoantibodies for factor V were unknown and such therapies have weak evidence.'], hint: None\n",

Clinically, it is characterized by severe cardiac arrhythmias including WPW syndrome, VT, and/or VF, dilated cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrest, and sudden death. Extra-cardiac features involving the nervous system and eyes have also been reported.4–7 DUFB11 variants have recently been independently proposed to cause histiocytoid cardiomyopathy. The efficacy of CA of PVCs triggering VF or polymorphic VT in idiopathic VF or channelopathies has been reported.2,3,8 Those PVCs could arise from the Purkinje system. Ablation therapy has also been reported in two cases of histiocytoid cardiomyopathy and VT, but the outcomes were far from satisfactory.9,10 The ablation target was the Purkinje tissue and anterior left bundle of His. One patient survived after a heart transplantation, and the other died of a cerebral haemorrhage after VAD therapy.9,10 Our case was a successful ablation of PVCs triggering TdP at the earliest ventricular sites. The patient died of uncontrolled heart failure due to cardiomyopathy 2 months later as a result.\\n\\nThe mechanism of ScTdP remains unclear, but it is assumed to be an unstable re-entry in the Purkinje network or triggered activity in the Purkinje cells. Histiocytoid cells are thought to correspond to abnormal Purkinje cells.11 In the case presented here, abnormal cells were occupying the subendocardium areas in both ventricles, while no fibrotic tissues were observed in those areas. Based on the pathological and electrophysiological findings, the PVCs were likely caused by triggered activity and associated with abnormal Purkinje cells. The perpetuation of the VT could have been caused by re-entry in the injured Purkinje network, because ablation of the narrow area in the RV suppressed the TdP.\\n\\nParticular attention should be given to the safety of CA in small patients. The expert consensus for CA is that VT with a deteriorating ventricular function is a Class I indication, even in infants, if medical therapy is not effective.1 We applied radiofrequency energy for 60\\u2009s for a total of 14 times at two different sites with the temperature control set below 55°C and a power limit of 30\\u2009W. Histopathology revealed the formation of transmural lesions replaced by fibrous tissue in the RV wall but not in the epicardium. This finding was quite satisfactory in terms of the adequacy of the depth of the ablation. At this level, abnormal cells associated with arrhythmias would have been eliminated without damaging the coronary arteries in the epicardium.\\n\\nConclusion\\nThe PVCs triggering TdP were successfully ablated in a 4-month-old girl with histiocytoid cardiomyopathy.

Despite of extensive pretreatment with radiation and conventional chemotherapy relapse occurred and was treated with sequential high-dose chemotherapy followed by transfusion of autologous peripheral stem cells. The high-dose chemotherapy course was complicated by refractory derailment of pineal gland insufficiency. The patient achieved a complete remission after high dose chemotherapy which lasted for 13 months. Subsequently, he developed a third relapse and died.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nTumors of the pineal gland are rare accounting for 0.4 - 1% of all primary tumors of the brain [1]. Different tumor types are found in the pineal region: tumors that derive from germ cells (germinomas and \"non-germinomatous\" germ cell tumors like embryonic carcinomas and teratomas), from parenchymal cells (pinealoblastomas and pineocytomas), and from glial cells are encountered as well as lesions that represent non neoplastic cysts [2]. In all series germ cell tumors represent the most common histology (60%) [2]. The peak incidence of germ cell tumors is in the second decade [3]. In contrast to the other tumors mentioned which have no sex preference, germ cell tumors are more frequent in men than in women [1]. First symptoms are often neurological signs and complaints caused by an obstructive hydrocephalus with headache, nausea, and vomiting and/or involvement of ocular pathways. Determination of histology, tumor markers in serum and CSF, and extent of disease are critical for optimal management of pineal region tumors. Five year survival rates following radiation range from 44 - 78% and depend on extent of disease, age, radiation volume and dose to the primary site but primarily on histology [4]. The five year survival of patients with germinoma is 76% as compared with 21% for those with a \"non-germinomatous\" germ cell tumor. \\n\\nThere is no established therapy for relapsing or refractory intracranial germinoma. In analogy to germinomas of the testis a higher curability may be expected with high dose chemotherapy followed by autologous blood stem-cell retransfusion [5]. For non germinomatous tumors no guidelines exist with respect to dosage, combination or sequence of chemotherapy and radiation.\\n\\nCase presentation\\nA 25-year old man became symptomatic by diabetes insipidus. Further examination revealed that these symptoms were caused by a primary AFP producing germinoma of the pineal gland.

Three weeks later chemotherapy according to the PEB-protocol was initiated: cisplatin 20 mg/m² i.v. d1-d5, etoposide 100 mg/m² i.v. d1-d5, and bleomycin 30 mg i.v. d1, 8, and 15. Four cycles were administered. In order to prevent bleomycin induced lung damage bleomycin was replaced by ifosfamide 1200 mg/m² i.v. twice daily (d1-d5) in two additional cycles.

Clinical examination and laboratory findings indicated a systemic process with cardiac involvement. Echocardiography revealed concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with enhanced echogenicity and preserved ejection fraction. Rectum biopsy confirmed amyloid deposition. The side effect of delayed diagnosis on prognosis and the appropriate diagnostic strategy has been discussed.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nLight-chain (AL) amyloidosis is a disorder characterized by deposition of insoluble, monoclonal immunoglobulin light-chain fragments in various tissues. Clinical features depend on organs involved but can include restrictive cardiomyopathy, nephrotic syndrome, hepatic failure, and peripheral/autonomic neuropathy. The patients often have a long period of a certain organ involved before systemic multiorgan involvement or heart failure has already developed. Cardiac involvement is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, especially in AL amyloidosis.1 Once congestive heart failure occurs in AL amyloidosis, median survival is less than 6 months if left untreated. Thus, an early and accurate diagnosis with an earlier start or more intensive treatment may have resulted in a better outcome.\\n\\nCase report\\nA 62-year-old male presented with a 15-day history of dyspnea on exertion, associated with both lower extremity edema.

Over the past 6 months, he developed a multiple system disorder, which included painless paresthesias in the lower limbs, erectile dysfunction, and chronic diarrhea. He had an average stool frequency of up to ten times per day, with no obvious blood or mucus and no abdominal pain or tenesmus. Unfortunately, previous stomach and rectum biopsy did not examine for accumulations of amyloid fibril protein. His family history was unremarkable.\\n\\nOn physical examination, his blood pressure was 82/56 mmHg and heart rate was 52 bpm. Significant jugular venous distention, moderate hepatomegaly, and lower extremity edema were noted. A neurological examination revealed weakness and muscular atrophy in the bilateral tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius. Hyporeflexia was noted on both knees and ankles.

An electromyography study demonstrated active denervation and chronic reinnervation changes in the tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius. Electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed sinus rhythm, low voltages in limb leads, QS waves in precordial and inferior leads, first-degree atrioventricular block, and prolonged QTc (Figure 1).

The major types of amyloidosis, classified on the basis of their precursor protein, include light-chain, senile systemic (wild-type transthyretin), hereditary (mutant transthyretin), and secondary (AA) diseases. The frequency of cardiac involvement varies among the types of amyloidosis and is common with AL disease.2 Myocardial amyloid involvement leads to a restrictive cardiac physiology with possible concomitant conduction system disease, and the patients may present with nonspecific dyspnea, lower extremity edema, and syncope.

      "Predicting with title: Light-chain cardiac amyloidosis with neuropathy: a case report., context: ['Echocardiography should be the first noninvasive test performed to evaluate for cardiac amyloidosis. Echocardiographic findings include biatrial dilatation and increased left ventricular wall thickness with diastolic dysfunction. Ejection fraction is generally preserved. These findings are also prevalent in other cardiac conditions such as hypertrophic nonobstructive cardiomyopathy. However, ECG of our patient revealed low voltages, which was not typical for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Increased myocardial echogenicity with a granular or sparkling appearance is the most characteristic feature, as seen in the case. But this feature has limited sensitivity in cardiac amyloidosis and may be more indicative of late-stage disease. Advanced echocardiographic techniques are beginning to reveal more about the underlying pathology and functional abnormalities. With the tissue Doppler imaging technique, measurement of myocardial tissue velocity allows detection of early diastolic wall motion abnormalities before development of heart failure. However, a limitation of tissue Doppler imaging lies in its inability to distinguish between actively contracting myocardium and adjacent tethered akinetic myocardial segments. This limitation can be overcome by strain and strain rate imaging, which derives from speckle tracking imaging and is better able to distinguish among segmental wall motion differences.3 It is particularly helpful and demonstrates a very typical pattern in cardiac amyloidosis, characterized by relative sparing of apical longitudinal contraction compared to basal contraction. This appearance is not typically seen in other cardiomyopathies such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and aortic stenosis.\\n\\nThe use of a combination of echocardiographic and electrocardiographic features increases specificity. A low voltage on the ECG and increased septal and posterior left ventricle wall thickness on the echocardiogram are highly specific for cardiac amyloidosis in the setting of biopsy-proven systemic amyloidosis. Low QRS voltages (all limb leads <5 mm in height) with poor R-wave progression in the chest leads (pseudoinfarction pattern) occur in up to 50% of patients with cardiac AL amyloidosis, and this is the most common finding in affected individuals. Ischemic cardiomyopathy may also result in decreased voltages and infarction pattern on ECG but leads to dilated, eccentric ventricular hypertrophy with reduced ejection fraction.

There are two types of amyloid that commonly infiltrate the nerve system. The first is familial amyloid polyneuropathy (also known as hereditary amyloidosis).6 The second is AL amyloidosis. Peripheral neuropathy occurs in 17% of patients with AL amyloidosis, making it the most common type of acquired amyloid polyneuropathy. Sensory-motor axonal polyneuropathy and carpal tunnel syndrome are the most common types of neuropathy associated with AL amyloidosis. Symptoms typically begin with painful paresthesias in the feet signifying small fiber involvement. As the disease progresses, it can affect larger nerve fibers and patients may complain of numbness and motor weakness.7 Up to 65% of patients with peripheral neuropathy also have autonomic nervous system involvement. The clinical manifestations of autonomic disorders are nonspecific and symptoms can include nausea, vomiting, early satiety, bloating, constipation, diarrhea, postural lightheadedness, and erectile dysfunction. Due to varying clinical symptoms, the diagnosis of amyloid neuropathy is often a challenge. However, it is important to recognize and distinguish neuropathy from diseases of the end organs themselves.

However many studies suggest different systemic effects related to PHPT, which could be enhanced by an abnormal cortisol release due to chronic stress of hyperparathyroidism. Being PHPT frequently found in the 6(th) to 7(th) decade of life, a careful and multifaceted approach should be taken.\\n\\n\\nMETHODS\\nWe report the case of an elderly patient with symptomatic PHPT and incidental pulmonary embolism. He was treated with hydration, zoledronic acid, cinacalcet and high-dose unfractionated heparin. Parathyroid surgery was successfully performed, but patient's conditions suddenly worsened because of a transient thyrotoxicosis, probably induced by a previous exposure to iodine load and/or thyroid surgical manipulation. A short-term treatment with beta-blockers was introduced for symptomatic relief. The patient also presented a transient hypercortisolism with elevated ACTH, likely due to stress related not only to aging and hospitalization but also to PHPT, resolved only four months after parathyroid surgery.\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nChronic hyperparathyroidism has been linked with increased all-cause mortality. A functional chronic hypercortisolism could be established, enhancing PHPT related disorders. Only parathyroid surgery has been demonstrated to cure PHPT and complications related, showing similar outcome between older and younger patients. However, the management of post-operative period should be more careful in fragile patients. In particular, the early diagnosis and treatment of a transient post-operative thyrotoxicosis could improve recovery. Due to the increase in prevalence and the evidence of many related complications even in asymptomatic PHPT, expert opinion-based guidelines for surgical treatment of PHPT should be developed especially for elderly patients.\\n\\nBackground\\nPrimary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is the third most common endocrinopathy seen today, frequently found in the 6th to 7th decade of life. PHPT mainly is a sporadic disorder, caused in 85% of the cases by a single adenoma, in 15% by multi-gland disease and rarely by parathyroid carcinoma. Less than 10% of cases are inheritable, often associated with multi-gland hyperplasia. The most common presentation of PHPT is an asymptomatic hypercalcemia, incidentally found on routine blood tests. However, many patients may suffer from minimal symptoms such as asthenia, constipation, polyuria, hypertension and neuro-psychiatric complications [1]. In some cases a renal colic is the first presentation of the disease. In older patients, concomitant morbidity and poly-pharmacotherapy may worsen symptoms and complications, and impact the management of PHPT [2].\"], hint: None\n",

The detection of hypercalcemia and elevated PTH levels was diagnostic of PHPT. The biochemical/clinical presentation could also raise the suspicion of parathyroid carcinoma, which was excluded by the histological examinations. Rehydration was the first measure to take in this patient, not only to correct dehydration and improve renal failure, but also to dilute calcium excretion. Bisphosphonate administration was effective in reducing calcium levels and bone resorption, in particular recent controlled trials demonstrated the superiority of zoledronate compared with previous treatments [3]. The addition of cinacalcet may be useful in the elderly or in not-surgical candidates, being well tolerated [4]. Parathyroid surgery is the only definite cure for PHPT, but the risks and benefits of surgery should be extensively considered in the elderly, given their more fragile state and co-morbidities [5]. Preoperative imaging with ultrasonography and scintigraphy may be helpful before elective surgery and in suspected parathyroid carcinoma, even if their sensitivity drops in detecting multi-glandular disease, as happened in our case report.\\n\\nOur finding of a transient thyrotoxicosis after parathyroid surgery could be due to a dual pathogenesis: a destructive thyroiditis and/or an iodine-induced hyperthyroidism. The first condition is fairly unknown and underestimated since the symptoms could be masked by other postoperative events [6]. Thyrotoxicosis seems to be related to an increased release of thyroid hormones and/or autoantigen during surgical manipulation, which could reactivate underlying autoimmune thyroiditis [7]. It could be influenced by other mechanisms, like preoperative hypercalcemic setting, pre-existing goiter and difficult parathyroid glands identification during surgical exploration [8]. Our patient had an euthyroid goiter, without abnormal MIBI-uptake in preoperative investigations nor previous or underlying autoimmune thyroiditis. Retrospectively, the only apparent risk factors were the goiter, the previous pronounced hypercalcemic condition and the occasional finding of a multi-gland disease.'], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: Transient hypercortisolism and symptomatic hyperthyroidism associated to primary hyperparathyroidism in an elderly patient: case report and literature review., context: ['The second possible cause of transient thyrotoxicosis could be related to the previous iodinated contrast media exposure, leading to hypersecretion of thyroid hormones. This phenomenon, known as the Jod-Basedow effect, usually develops over 2 to 12\\xa0weeks, typically in old patients with underlying thyroid disease or living in areas of iodine deficiency. Exposure to a large iodine load can also cause acute destructive thyroiditis in people without pre-existing thyroid disorders [9]. TcO4-scintigraphy could not discriminate the cause of hyperthyroidism, since pertechnetate is trapped by thyroid, but not organified and the resulting tracer uptake may be reduced. As happened in our case, the assessment of urinary iodine concentration may be helpful [10]. Some researchers have investigated the incidence and the role of prophylactic measures to reduce the risk of iodine-induced thyrotoxicosis, without conclusive findings [11]. In our case the concomitant neck surgery could have been a precipitating factor in the pathogenesis of hyperthyroidism.\\n\\nBoth these conditions are usually self-limited and anti-thyroid drugs are not indicated. However, a short-term treatment with beta-blockers could be required for symptomatic relief, especially in fragile patients.\\n\\nSince chronic hyperparathyroidism has been linked with increased all-cause mortality, in asymptomatic and elderly patients the optimal timing for parathyroidectomy is controversial [12]. Cardiovascular complications are the leading cause of this increased mortality [13], linked not only to mineral homeostasis disruption but also to a direct effect of PTH on cardiovascular structures [14]. The complexity of PTH functions is further highlighted by data suggesting a bidirectional link between PTH and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system, playing a synergic role in enhancing metabolic and cardiovascular complications [15]. Several studies have also evidenced an altered hypotalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in PHPT, potentially contributing to cortical bone damage [16]. In vitro evidence supports a stimulatory effect of PTH on cortisol secretion [17] and of calcemia on ACTH release [18]. In vivo data show a hypercortisolism, loss of circadian rhythm and lack of cortisol suppression after low-dose DST in PHPT [19], which are not always recovered after surgical cure, as happened in our case.\\n\\nAlteration of cortisol expression and its circadian variability are also typical of aging, hospitalization, psychiatric and stress conditions [20]. False-positive results of the 1\\xa0mg DST could be influenced by absorption, liver or renal alterations and the use of alcohol or drugs inducing CYP3A4. Being PHPT a long-standing disease frequently affecting old patients, the activation of adrenal function seems to recall a functional hypercortisolism due to chronic stress, which could be preserved by aging and other co-morbidities, enhancing the damaging effects of prolonged exposure to stress hormones [21].'], hint: None\n"

If the virus reactivates in the trigeminal ganglia, it can cause varicella zoster ophthalmicus, which can have severe ocular complications. We report a case of a 73-year-old woman in severe immunosuppression due to treatment with mycophenolate mofetil, glucocorticosteroids and a tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitor. The reactivation caused superior orbital fissure syndrome, which has only rarely been described in relation to varicella zoster virus reactivation. In our case, the syndrome was seen along with severe encephalitis.\\n\\nBackground\\nThe incidence of varicella zoster virus (VZV) reactivation is increased in immunosuppressed patients, and reactivation of herpes zoster is a common adverse event reported in clinical trials with tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitors (TNF-alpha) [1].\\n\\nVaricella zoster ophthalmicus (VZO) is caused by reactivation of latent virus in the trigeminal ganglion, and ocular complications may include blepharitis, keratoconjunctivitis, iritis, scleritis and acute retinal necrosis [2]. Another ophthalmological complication is ophthalmoplegia, which can be seen in relation to VZO, and there is a slight increase in simultaneous aseptic meningitis when VZO is accompanied by ophthalmoplegia [3].\\n\\nSuperior orbital fissure syndrome (SOFS) is rare in relation to VZO, but a closely related entity named orbital apex syndrome (OAS) has been correlated with the occurrence of VZO; however, only in a few cases [2,4]. In SOFS, there is no lesion to the optic nerve in contrast to OAS, in which the optic nerve is compromised, leading to reduced visual acuity [5].\\n\\nCase Presentation\\nA 73-year-old woman with active pyoderma gangrenosum was treated with both mycophenolate mofetil and glucocorticoids for years. Due to worsening of her skin condition, she began a series of treatments with infliximab, a TNF-alpha inhibitor. She received 400 mg intravenous treatment on two occasions 14 days apart. Approximately 4 weeks after her last treatment, she started complaining of severe, right-sided, retrobulbar pain and was evaluated by an ophthalmologist. The examination only revealed slight periorbital edema.\\n\\nSeven days later, she was admitted with near-complete ophthalmoplegia of her right eye; dilated, fixed pupil; near-complete ptosis; severe, retrobulbar pain; prominent edema of the periorbital surroundings on both sides, and a feeling of altered sensibility in the area of the first trigeminal branch on the right side. The ophthalmoplegia and ptosis became complete within 12 h of admission. She complained of slightly impaired vision on her right eye, but ophthalmological reevaluation revealed full visual acuity in the affected eye. No skin vesicles were noticed, but the fluorescein test of her right eye showed diffuse uptake (fig. 1).'], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: Superior Orbital Fissure Syndrome and Ophthalmoplegia Caused by Varicella Zoster Virus with No Skin Eruption in a Patient Treated with Tumor Necrosis Alpha Inhibitor., context: [\"On the 7th day of admission, the patient became febrile and fluctuated in consciousness. Only a few days later, her left eye also became ophthalmoplegic with fixed, dilated pupil. Ophthalmological examination revealed normal tension, clear anterior chamber and bilateral well-defined optic discs.\\n\\nDuring the admission, the patient's condition deteriorated. She became progressively encephalopathic and then unconscious. The patient died during assessment of complications related to her encephalopathy.\\n\\nDifferential Diagnosis and Tests\\nAt the initial workup, a computed tomography scan of the cerebrum including cerebral angiography was performed and found to be normal. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan with intravenous contrast and MRI venous angiography was carried out, revealing meningeal enhancement in the posterior fossa and the area around the cerebellopontine angle on the right side (fig. 2). This was strongly suspicious of basal meningitis, and a lumbar puncture showed 114 white blood cells with 96% being of lymphocytic origin. The cerebrospinal fluid was considered free of malignant cells and bacteria, but positive for VZV DNA on polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A PCR of the fluid from the right eye was also positive for VZV.\\n\\nTreatment\\nFrom the time of admission, the patient received intravenous treatment with acyclovir initially 750 mg three times per day, but the dosage of acyclovir was increased to 1,000 mg three times per day once the PCR for herpes virus family came back positive for VZV. She continued on an unaltered oral dosage of prednisone at 15 mg per day.\\n\\nDiscussion\\nReactivation of herpes zoster is more likely to happen in patients with compromised cell-mediated immunity as a result of i.e. common aging, the use of immunosuppressive therapies, or concomitant illness. The severity of the zoster outbreak is correlated with the degree of immunoincompetence [6].\\n\\nMcDonald et al. [7] found a significantly higher risk of herpes zoster in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with TNF-alpha inhibitors compared with those treated with, i.e., sulfasalazine. The patients treated with TNF-alpha inhibitors, who developed herpes zoster, were subdivided into three groups, and a significantly higher risk was associated with the use of infliximab compared to etanercept and adalimumab. Another retrospective study showed significantly greater risk when using infliximab and adalimumab compared with no TNF-alpha inhibitor treatment [8].\"], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: Superior Orbital Fissure Syndrome and Ophthalmoplegia Caused by Varicella Zoster Virus with No Skin Eruption in a Patient Treated with Tumor Necrosis Alpha Inhibitor., context: ['A case report by Allorent et al. [9] described a patient treated with mycophenolate mofetil who developed hemi-cauda equina syndrome due to varicella zoster meningoradiculitis. However, this patient also had renal function impairment, which is known to increase the risk of VZV reactivation [10]. The study by Koo et al. [11] on the incidence of herpes zoster reactivation in patients after heart transplantation showed treatment with mycophenolate mofetil as an independent risk factor for herpes zoster. Using glucocorticoids has also been shown to have a significant association with varicella zoster reactivation [12].\\n\\nSOFS consists of dysfunction of the oculomotor nerve (III), the trochlear nerve (IV), the abducens nerve (VI) and the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve (V1). If there is involvement of the optical nerve (II) as well, it is called OAS. The causes of both SOFS and OAS are many, i.e. inflammation, infection, neoplasia, iatrogenic, trauma and vascular conditions [5].\\n\\nThe ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve is purely sensory. It supplies the cornea, the skin of the forehead, eyelid and nose, and it gives off branches to the tentorium cerebelli, dura mater and the posterior area of the falx cerebri [4], possibly explaining a way for the virus to reach the brain causing encephalitis and meningitis.\\n\\nThe pathogenesis of OAS in relation to VZO is thought to be related to immune complexes, direct tissue infection with the virus and/or secondary vasculitis [4]. The same is likely to be true for the SOFS when it occurs in relation to VZO.\\n\\nFollowing reactivation of VZV in the ganglion and the spread along the first branch of the trigeminal nerve, direct tissue infection and an immune response may take place within the orbit. The immune response is both humoral and cellular, resulting in inflammation with clinical manifestations of pain, hyperemia, edema, heat and loss of function. It is mediated by the release of lipid mediators, cytokines and altered vascular permeability. The involvement of orbital tissue ipsilateral to cutaneous lesions supports the notion that the pathogenesis is likely to be due to direct viral infection in the orbital cells and a consequent immune system reaction. Circulating immune complex-mediated mechanisms could, however, potentially involve the contralateral orbital tissue resulting in the same symptoms [4], explaining the involvement of the other eye in our patient.\\n\\nThe viral replication of VZV is of short duration and confined to the early stage of the disease. Antiviral therapies should be administered early to have an effect. In our patient, the first symptom of retrobulbar pain was likely due to the onset of viral replication, and the antiviral therapy was administered at a late stage of the disease. The lack of vesicles or other types of apparent skin rashes delayed the diagnosis, but the patient was administered acyclovir intravenously immediately after the first results of the lumbar puncture with 114 white blood cells.'], hint: None\n",

Our patient did not have vesicular skin eruption but clearly had fluorescein uptake in the cornea.\\n\\nConclusion\\nPatients treated with TNF-alpha inhibitors, mycophenolate mofetil and glucocorticoids are at greater risk of VZV reactivation compared to patients with no such treatment. This case report highlights that herpes zoster does not always have a benign course, and caution must be taken for this category of patients. Immunologically incompetent patients with VZO should be treated with antiviral drugs at the first signs of reactivation in order to try to prevent secondary ocular complications. Oral antiviral medication should be switched to intravenous treatment in addition to corticosteroids if there is any kind of cranial nerve palsy, SOFS or OAS.\\n\\nThe patient in this case report was heavily immunosuppressed with three medications that all increase the risk of VZV reactivation. The treatment and management of VZO should be twofold: (1) systemic treatment with corticosteroids based on their anti-inflammatory effects and (2) systemic treatment with antiviral therapies. Treatment within 72 h is the most commonly suggested guideline, and fast treatment should reduce the risk of ocular complications. It seems reasonable to believe that early treatment might also prevent the occurrence of SOFS and spread to the contralateral side.\\n\\nStatement of Ethics\\nWritten informed consent was obtained from the next of kin of the patient before publication of this case report.\\n\\nDisclosure Statement\\nNo conflict of interest is present for any of the authors.\\n\\nFig. 1 Diffuse uptake of fluorescein in the eye with complete ophthalmoplegia.\\n\\nFig. 2 T1 sequence of an MRI scan showing basal enhancement of the leptomeninges.'], hint: None\n",

So, in patients treated with belatacept who develop digestive symptoms such as diarrhea or intestinal bleeding, we recommend performing early colonoscopy and considering belatacept withdrawal in case of suggestive endoscopic and histologic findings in order to avoid colonic sequela.\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\nBelatacept is a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) Ig fusion protein mostly used for kidney transplant rejection prophylaxis, in association with steroids and mycophenolate mofetil[1]. Belatacept selectively inhibits T cell activation and was recently demonstrated to be superior to cyclosporin in patients with renal transplants in terms of renal function with equivalent survival[2]. Frequent adverse events associated with belatacept are anemia, disturbance of bowel habits and infections, especially urinary tract infections, with no need to stop treatment in most of cases. Here, we report a case of severe stricturing Crohn’s disease (CD)-like colitis due to belatacept administration in a renal transplant recipient.\\n\\nCASE REPORT\\nWe report the case of a 62-year-old man who received a first kidney allograft from a deceased donor in September 2013. His end-stage renal disease was attributed to chronic glomerulonephritis. After an induction treatment by thymoglobulin and methylprednisolone pulses, the immunosuppression regimen consisted of tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and steroids. There was no immediate complication after transplantation and the nadir of serum creatinin was 2.24 mg/dL. Rapidly, after two months, tacrolimus was withdrawn due to nephrotoxicity (histologically proven) and replaced with everolimus which was also stopped due to development of lymphocele and proteinuria. In February 2014, belatacept was started at a dose of 5 mg/kg intravenously every month in association with mycophenolate mofetil in order to decrease corticosteroids to the level of 10 mg/d.\"], hint: None\n",

In October 2015, because of worsening of the diarrhea, a stool culture was performed which was positive for Campylobacter jejuni. Antibiotics course was prescribed with some efficacy but the diarrhea persisted.\\n\\nIn February 2016, the patient was hospitalized for bloody stools with anemia and abdominal pain for which blood transfusion was necessary. A colonoscopy was rapidly performed showing large round shaped deep ulcers with normal surrounding mucosa. These ulcers were located in the caecum, transverse colon, left colon and sigmoid colon and were compatible with the diagnosis of CD (Figure 1). The terminal ileum and rectum were normal. Histologic examination of the colonic biopsies showed acute colitis with ulcerations, crypt abscesses, lymphocytes and neutrophil polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration. Neither crypt dystrophy nor granuloma was found (Figure 2). A small bowel wireless capsule endoscopy was also performed without mucosal abnormalities.\\n\\nFigure 1 Endoscopic finding before and after withdrawal of belatacept.

A follow-up colonoscopy was performed in June 2016 which showed persistence of the large ulcers previously described and the appearance of a passable ulcerated inflammatory stricture at the left colonic flexure (Figure 1). Histologic examination showed acute colitis without signs of chronic inflammation (Figure 2). No signs of cytomegalovirus colitis were found on histology, such as owl’s eye inclusion bodies. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of colonic biopsies was positive for human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6) and negative for cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus. Also, PCR analysis for cytomegalovirus in the blood was negative. Belatacept was therefore withdrawn in June 2016 and the patient was treated with low dose tacrolimus for prevention of allograft rejection and an increased dose of steroids to treat colonic inflammation. In October 2016, the patient was free from diarrhea but described left-sided abdominal pain with partial obstructive symptoms probably due to the colonic stricture. The colonoscopy performed four months after belatacept withdrawal showed a complete healing of the ulcers in the left colon and a non-inflammatory stricture of the left colonic flexure which could not be passed (Figure 1). The stricture was not dilated as clinical symptoms were mild. PCR for HHV-6 was negative on colonic biopsies and only slightly positive on biopsies targeted to the colonic stricture. At the last clinical outpatient visit in January 2017 the patient was asymptomatic with no signs of acute renal rejection.\\n\\nDISCUSSION\\nWe have described here for the first time the case of a severe stricturing CD-like colitis occurring in a patient with a kidney allograft treated with belatacept. Gastrointestinal side effects are well known in renal transplant recipients receiving immunosuppressive therapy, especially mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). Indeed, MMF has multiple side effects and those affecting the gastrointestinal tract mostly occur during the first 6 mo after the onset of treatment[3]. These side effects include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, whereas bleeding is less reported. A recent retrospective study investigated endoscopic findings in patients treated with MMF having diarrhea. In most of the cases the colonic mucosa was normal and the common lesion was simple erythema without deep ulcer or stricture[3]. Our patient had diarrhea after introduction of MMF with liquid stools but no bleeding, and this diarrhea improved after MMF withdrawal. Although acute colitis was first thought to be due to MMF, appearance of bleeding, large ulcers without erythema at colonoscopy and worsening of endoscopic lesions after MMF withdrawal led us to suspect the involvement of belatacept.'], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: Stricturing Crohn's disease-like colitis in a patient treated with belatacept., context: ['Ipilimumab and tremelimumab, two therapeutic monoclonal antibodies against CTLA-4 and prescribed in cancer patients, have previously been implicated in the development of severe and extensive forms of inflammatory bowel disease with colonic ulcerations[4]. CTLA-4 is a homologue of CD28 that binds CD80 and CD86 with higher affinity, and thereby down-regulates T cell activation. Anti CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies block its interaction with CD80 and CD86 and favour CD28 engagement and consequently T cell activation and proliferation. The overactivation of the immune system in patients treated with anti CTLA-4 antibodies associated with a specific gut microflora may explain the development of treatment-mediated CD-like colitis[5]. Abatacept and belatacept are two recombinant fusion proteins comprising a fragment of the Fc domain of human IgG1 and the extracellular domain of human CTLAA-4. Similar to CTLA-4, abatacept and belatacept compete with CD28 for CD80 and CD86 binding to block co-stimulatory signaling, thus selectively modulating T-cell activation. In comparison to abatacept, belatacept confers higher affinity for CD 80/86 ligands and has a slower dissociation rates. It could also alter regulatory T cell development, which plays an important part in intestinal inflammation. Abatacept is effective for rheumatoid arthritis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis[6], and belatacept is currently used for kidney transplant rejection prophylaxis[1]. It has been showed that abatacept was not effective for the treatment of active ulcerative colitis and CD[6]. It may be surprising that belatacept induces CD-like colitis given it has the opposite effect from anti-CTLA-4 antibodies. However, cases of colitis have been also described in patients treated with abatacept (Table 1). A first case of ulcerative colitis was reported in 2006 in a 55 year old male patient treated with abatacept for rheumatoid arthritis[7]. The diagnosis of ulcerative colitis was made 15 mo after start of abatacept and digestive symptoms improved after abatacept withdrawal and mesalamine treatment. Two other cases of ulcerative colitis developing five and 23 mo after abatacept introduction in rheumatoid arthritis patients were reported. The first one was treated with mesalamine and infliximab and the second one with prednisolone and mesalamine[8]. Similarly to these case reports, the severe colitis occurred 23 mo after belatacept introduction in our patient. Macroscopically, the endoscopic lesions were more in favor of CD compared to abatacept-induced colitis, and the large deep ulcerations were similar to anti CTLA-4 enterocolitis. The histological findings in our patients described acute colitis with polymorph leucocyte infiltration and crypt abscesses without atrophy, distortion, branching or budding of crypts. These findings were also described in abatacept and anti CTLA-4 colitis. The most striking finding in our case is the development on belatacept treatment of an inflammatory stricture of the left colon. After belatacept withdrawal and pre'], hint: None\n",

It may be a direct effect of belatacept, which could alter the development of regulatory T cells, and therefore lead to uncontrolled intestinal inflammation. Another hypothesis may be an indirect effect of belatacept which confers a profound immunosuppression leading to the development of infectious colitis. Cytomegalovirus colitis was ruled out by careful histologic examination and negative PCR analyses in the blood and in colonic biopsies. PCR in biopsies was however, strongly positive for HHV-6. HHV-6 reactivation in patients with solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been reported to be associated with intestinal disease[9,10]. Moreover, HHV-6 was found in colonic mucosa of inflammatory bowel disease patients in 44% of the cases and associated with disease activity and use of immunosuppressive therapy[11]. HHV-6 intensity also correlated with endoscopic severity in ulcerative colitis. After belatacept withdrawal and mucosal healing, PCR for HHV-6 in colonic biopsies was found to be negative or slightly positive in our patient.\\n\\nThus, we report here a case of CD-like colitis in a patient treated with belatacept. Despite belatacept withdrawal, the patient developed a severe colonic stricture which may impact quality of life and necessitate subsequent colonic surveillance. Therefore in patients treated with belatacept who develop digestive symptoms such as diarrhea or intestinal bleeding, we recommend performing early colonoscopy and considering belatacept withdrawal in case of suggestive endoscopic and histologic findings.\\n\\nCOMMENTS\\nCase characteristics'], hint: None\n",

Recent advances in multiplex genotyping based on circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) provide a strong and non-invasive alternative for detection of the resistance mechanism.\\n\\n\\nMETHODS\\nHere we report a multiple metastatic NSCLC patient who was detected to have pure EGFR 19 exon deletion (negative for EML4-ALK and ROS1 in both IHC-based and sequencing assay) in the primary lesion and responded to first-line and second-line EGFR-TKI treatments (erlotinib then HY-15772). At 8 months, most lesions remained well controlled except for the liver metastases which presented dramatic progression. Considering the high risk of bleeding in rebiopsy of hepatic lesions, we conducted a multiplex genomic profiling with ctDNA. Results reported coexistence of EGFR mutation and EML4-ALK gene translocation in plasma which heavily indicated that ALK was the primary reason for progression of the liver lesions. This deduction was supported by the repeated response to ALK inhibitors (crizotinib then AP26113) of the hepatic metastases.\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nThis is the first report of the existence of ALK rearrangement in metastatic lesions in an EGFR mutated patient. It highlighted the feasibility and advantages of using ctDNA multiplex genotyping in identifying the heterogeneity across lesions and the resistance mechanism of targeted treatments.\\n\\nBackground\\nAdvances in geno-typing have changed the clinical practice of treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), especially non-squamous types where driver mutations, e.g. epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations and echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (EML4-ALK) translocation are commonly present. Agents that target EGFR activating mutations (gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib, etc.) or ALK rearrangement (crizotinib, etc.) derive significantly greater benefits than cytotoxic chemotherapy in patients who harbor these gene alterations, which is consistently proved by extensive large-scale randomized controlled trials [1, 2]. In order to deliver an appropriate first-line treatment regimen, detection of EGFR mutation and ALK rearrangement are recommended as routine genetic profiling for non-squamous NSCLC or non-smoking populations [3]. In recent years, some selective inhibitors that can overcome the resistance to first generation inhibitors of these driver alterations have also been developed, e.g., AZD9291 and CO-1686, some more effective inhibitors against both EGFR sensitizing and resistance T790M mutations [4]; or ceretinib, aletinib and AP26113, the agents that are effective for both ALK fusion and some secondary gatekeeper mutations [5].'], hint: None\n",

FISH, RT-PCR and Ventana IHC are all currently accepted methods for detection of ALK rearrangement. In recent years, the development and advances in high throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS) have allowed the simultaneous profiling of alterations in multiple genes [6]. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is released or excreted by tumour cells and circulates in the blood of a cancer patient; analysis of the fraction of mutant-alleles from ctDNA compared to normal-alleles from the patients’ normal genome provides opportunities for minimally-invasive cancer diagnosis and tumor monitoring [7]. Detection with ctDNA, which originates from all potential lesions, could overcome the disadvantages of single site biopsy given that the intra-tumoral and inter-lesional heterogeneity is common [6, 8]. Enrichment of plasma ctDNA and incorporation with the next generation deep sequencing techniques allow us to simultaneously detect the gene alterations of interest, e.g. EGFR/BRAF/HER2 mutations, ALK/ROS1/RET rearrangements, MET amplification, etc. in NSCLC, especially when it is difficult to obtain sufficient tissue samples.\\n\\nEGFR mutations and ALK rearrangement are generally considered to be mutually exclusive. However, some recent surveys and case reports showed co-existence of the two alterations within the same lesion [9, 10]. Here, we report an advanced NSCLC case with EGFR exon 19 deletion who experienced single-site progression in the liver after primary response to EGFR-TKI treatments and showed good response when adding crizotinib after the detection of ALK rearrangement signal through ctDNA. This special case highlights the feasibility and necessity of using ctDNA multiplex genomic profiling as an alternative approach in molecular diagnosis of NSCLC or in the exploration of the underlying mechanism in resistance to targeted therapies.

Thus, we firstly withdrew erlotinib and delivered methylprednisolone pulse therapy (500\\xa0mg qd * 5\\xa0days). However, no improvement was observed, which lead us to the diagnosis of lymphangitis carcinomatosa due to disease progression. Pemetrexed 0.8\\xa0g plus bevacizumab 300\\xa0mg (the tumor board decided to use a platinum-free regimen due to low tolerance to platinum of this patient, ECOG performance score 2–3), was then administered, but the lesions continued to grow rapidly.

In this case, the progressed liver metastases were large, bulky, and scattered. Radiotherapy or radiofrequency ablation was not an appropriate option. Metastatic hepatic lesions were supplied by portal vein system rather than hepatic artery system. Thus, transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) might not derive significant benefits. On the other hand, this case progressed dramatically after showing resistance to EGFR-TKIs. In this case, switching to chemotherapy is suggested according to what IMPRESS trial indicated [12]. Considering the previous evidence of the patients’ insensitivity to pemetrexed, we decided to use gemcitabine single agent chemotherapy. Meanwhile, we continued the use of HY-15772 API since all extra-hepatic lesions remained stable or even undetectable in the images, which suggested these lesions remained sensitive to HY-15772 API.'], hint: None\n",

In this case, as the entire left lobe of the liver was occupied by metastatic lesions that were loosened in structure, multidisciplinary consultation opinions suggested that conducting a fine-needle biopsy would be dangerous due to the high risk of bleeding. Recent advances in non-invasive rebiopsy approaches such as multiplex genomic profiling of ctDNA provided us an alternative [13]. We decided to obtain peripheral blood from this patient to perform a NSCLC-related multiplex genotyping, in order to clarify the resistance mechanism. Surprisingly, in addition to the 19del EGFR mutation that was previously discovered in the primary lesion, EML4-ALK fusion with relatively high abundance in plasma was detected. Given that the extra-hepatic lesions were all under control, indicating their lasting response to HY-15772 API, we added Crizotinib, the only approved agent to inhibit ALK-driving tumors, to the regimen without withdrawing the EGFR suppressor. Previous reports suggested no significant superimposed toxicity in dual treatment with EGFR and ALK inhibitors [14]. In this case, the patient presented rapid relief without any grade III adverse events. Undoutedly, the timely addition of ALK inhibitors salvaged the patient as previous gemcitabine showed no efficacy.\\n\\nThough some previous studies reported co-existence of EGFR and ALK in the same lesions, this is the first report showing ALK rearragement in distant metastatic lesions in a patient potentially harboring pure EGFR mutations in the primary lesion. Since rebiopsy for the liver metastases in the left lobe was not an option in this case, we had no direct evidence that the liver progression was driven by ALK fusion. However, the great abundance of EML4-ALK fusion signals in the plasma upon disease progression and the significant response after adding crizotinib (as well as the AP26113 API after resistance to crizotinib) strongly supported the existence of ALK fusion in the growing liver metastases. In addition, it was not likely that the primary lesion harbored concurrent EGFR mutation and ALK fusion because both routine ARMS and NGS re-analysis showed that no ALK fusion was detected and the pulmonary lesions were all in good control by HY-15772 API when the hepatic metastases progressed. Such heterogeneity might be more common than we have previously acknowledged, and might have a great impact on treatment strategy. In the past, we could only detect genetic alterations with site by site tissue samples. It was too difficult to obtain tissues from all lesions; multiplex genotyping with ctDNA might help address this issue. Thus, with the current technology, we should reevaluate the heterogeneity across different lesions and their incidence.

Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a common cause of systemic vasculitis (1). The disease frequently affects the lungs, kidneys, and nervous and cutaneous systems. In contrast to systemic vasculitis, vasculitis limited to single organs has also been identified (2). For example, renal- and pulmonary-limited types are considered mild forms of AAV (2, 3). In addition to these major target organs, other organs can occasionally be affected. For example, otitis media with AAV (OMAAV) is considered a part of limited organ-type vasculitis (4). Hepatic aneurysm is another a rare presentation of AAV (5-8), and retinal, breast, and urogenital structures can also become target organs on occasion (9). In addition, muscles can also become a target organ of vasculitis (10-12). Previous reports have shown that the lower limbs are primarily affected in vasculitis.\\n\\nWe herein report an unusual case of vasculitis that affects all limbs.\\n\\nCase Report\\nA 58-year-old Japanese man was referred to our hospital for muscle pain and weakness. Two weeks before admission, the patient noticed left-knee pain. A prior physician diagnosed the patient as gout arthritis, given that the patient had a history of several previous gout attacks.\\n\\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, vitamin B12, and allopurinol were administered. One week before admission, the patient experienced worsening pain in his limbs and was unable to stand up alone. The patient was then brought to the hospital. He had been healthy before this episode, except for having gout arthritis. He took no medications except for a prior prescription from his physician. He was a current smoker (40 packs over 40 years) and drank 1-2 L of beer daily. He had no history of traveling abroad or contact with animals during the last year.'], hint: None\n",

Involuntary weight loss was not reported. His blood pressure was 162/102 mmHg, heart rate was a regular 109 beats per minute, and body temperature was 37.5 °C. He reported not feeling cold. His respiratory rate was 16 breaths per minute. Percutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO2) was 97% in room air. A physical examination showed no remarkable findings expect for muscle weakness and tenderness. Manual muscle testing (MMT) was 4/5 for both his upper and lower limbs. The detailed MMT results were as follows: MMT (R/L) trapezius 4/4, deltoid 4/4, biceps 4/4, triceps 4/4, brachioradialis 4/4, iliopsoas 4/4, quadriceps 4/4, hamstrings 4/4, anterior tibialis 4/4, and gastrocnemius 4/4. The extent of muscle weakness was similar in the proximal and distal muscles. Grasping pain in the upper and lower limbs was also present. Neck flexor/extensor muscles were well preserved, and the patient could easily lift his neck. Dysphagia was not observed.\\n\\nThe patient's level of consciousness was clear. No paralysis or sensory disorder was observed. In addition, cranial nerve impairment and dysarthria were not detected. Stocking and glove distribution of sensory loss were also not observed. However, the patient complained of limb pain but did not complain of numbness, a burning sensation, or pain in his hands and feet. We could not identify swelling of his joints, muscles, or superficial lymph node. Swelling of his left knee was not obvious at admission.\\n\\nNo eruption or erythema were observed, nor was Gottron's sign detected. The results from the complete blood count, biochemical, coagulation, urinalysis, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and endocrinological tests are shown in Table 1. The white blood cell (WBC) count and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were elevated. A slight abnormality in the liver function test was also found. The creatinine kinase (CK) level was normal at admission, and no electrolyte disorder was identified. Urinary testing did not suggest the presence of glomerulonephritis. A cerebrospinal fluid examination was also normal. In addition, the thyroid function and adrenal gland function were within normal ranges (Table 1); however, chest X-ray showed a mild emphysematous change. Consistent with this, computed tomography (CT) showed emphysematous changes and a solitary hepatic cyst. No interstitial pneumonia was detected. Electrocardiogram (ECG) testing showed normal sinus rhythm. Cardiac ultrasound showed good wall motion without vegetation or pericardial effusion. The patient was admitted for a further examination to focus on inflammation and the cause of his muscle weakness and tenderness.\\n\\nTable 1.

Traditional extrinsic compression with radial flow cessation leads to a local milieu likely associated with an increase in probability of radial artery occlusion (RAO). Our technique involves obtaining ipsilateral radial artery access distal to the neck of the RAP followed by a prolonged sheath dwell time covering the neck of the RAP which allows the RAP sac to thrombose and maintains radial artery lumen patency. © 2016 The Authors. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\nRAP is a rare complication of transradial access (TRA) and can occur as a sequela of arterial wall trauma and inadequate hemostasis after TRI. According Lemaitre J et al only 22 cases of RAP have been reported in world literature until 2006 1. In a recent publication only five cases of RAP were detected after 16,808 TRA (3 out of 10,000 catheterizations, 0,03%) 2, which is significantly lower compared to frequency of femoral pseudoaneurysm (0.6%) complicating femoral access 3. The prevalence of RAP may increase in the future due to growing popularity of TRI.\\n\\nTreatment of RAPs has evolved through the years. Initially surgical treatment was the dominant form of management for RAP. Subsequently, many cases have been treated with ultrasound‐guided mechanical compression. Recently, thrombin injection under ultrasound guidance has become the preferred treatment method.\\n\\nWe describe a novel technique for treatment of RAP using ipsilateral radial artery catheterization with long introducer sheath placement and gentle mechanical compression isolating the pseudoaneurysm with resultant cessation of flow in the sac, thrombosis and subsequent closure.\\n\\nCASE PRESENTATION\\nA 68‐year‐old man with previous posterior MI, persistent atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and moderately depressed left ventricular function (EF\\u2009=\\u20090,44) was admitted with life‐style limiting CCS class III angina. Diagnostic coronary angiography and possible PCI was planned using radial access. He underwent cardiac catheterization from the right radial using a 16 cm 6F hydrophilic introducer sheath (Terumo Interventional Systems, Japan). The radial artery had an anomalous origin from the mid‐segment of brachial artery. Coronary stenoses were identified in the right coronary artery (RCA) and PCI was planned as a second stage in 2–3 weeks. At the time of diagnostic examination patient was on warfarin therapy and additional clopidogrel was prescribed for the forthcoming PCI procedure. The International Normalized Ratio (INR) at the time of angiography was 1.09. The sheath was removed and hemostasis was achieved using TR band (Terumo Interventional Systems, Japan). Patient was discharged 6 hr after diagnostic procedure and a small hematoma was noted after removal of hemostatic device without any signs of bleeding.'], hint: None\n",

This swelling appeared 48 hr following discharge after lifting a heavy object with the right hand. A systolic bruit was audible over the mass and duplex ultrasonography demonstrated an oval‐shape dual chamber pseudoaneurysm measuring 49 X 38 mm, partially filled with thrombus. Pseudoaneurysm sac was connected to the radial artery lumen through a long (6 mm) and narrow (2 mm in diameter) neck (Fig. 2). Radial artery was patent and INR at the time of repeat hospitalization was 1.57.\\n\\nFigure 1 Pulsatile swelling at the right wrist just proximal to the previous puncture point of radial artery (arrow).\\n\\nFigure 2 Duplex ultrasonography demonstrated dual chamber (arrowheads) pseudoaneurysm of radial artery (RA) with turbulent blood flow and narrow neck connection (arrow) with RA lumen. Pseudoaneurysm sac was partially filled with thrombotic mass.\\n\\nAt this point we contemplated a combined strategy of PCI of RCA and repair of RAP.\\n\\nWe decided to use the affected radial artery as the access site for PCI, because ultrasonography indicated presence of sufficient length and diameter of intact artery distal to RAP for puncture and catheterization. After successful puncture of radial artery distal to RAP, a small vessel dilator (5F) was inserted into RA lumen and retrograde radial artery angiography was performed using low pressure manual contrast injection. Radial artery angiography confirmed RA patency and significant deviation of its anatomic course at the site of RAP was seen with the signs of RA lumen narrowing as a result of extrinsic RA compression (Fig. 3a). Pseudoaneurysm was visualized with turbulent blood flow into aneurysm sac with QCA measured dimensions of 38.7 X 36.8 mm. After advancing a 0.014” Prowater guidewire (Asahi Intecc, Japan), a 21cm 6F hydrophilic introducer sheath (Terumo Interventional Systems, Japan) was placed covering the neck of RAP therefore isolating the aneurysm sac from the blood circulation (Fig. 3b). PCI of RCA was performed through the 6F sheath (procedure duration 34 min) using a 6 French JR4 guide catheter, 0.014” Prowater guidewire (Asahi Intecc, Japan) and 3.5–15 mm Xience drug‐eluting stent. 70 Units/Kg of unfractionated heparin was administered intravenously at the beginning of the procedure. The sheath was left in RA lumen after completion of PCI for 8 hr. The sheath was attached to a pressurized heparinized saline flush using a standard arterial line setup, with 500 units/hour of heparin administered via the sheath in a monitored post‐procedure unit. Additional light mechanical compression was applied at the RAP site using an external compression bandage dressing.'], hint: None\n",

Vascular sheath was removed and patent hemostasis technique was used with TR band (Terumo Interventional Systems, Japan). After removal of the band the patient was discharged from the hospital following 2‐hr monitoring.\\n\\nDuplex ultrasonography at 2‐month follow‐up revealed persistent closure of RAP and good patency of radial artery.

Over time, arterial blood flow under high pressure creates a cavity outlined by inflammatory cells and fibroblasts subsequently replaced by fibrous tissue and the inner surface covered by endothelium.\\n\\nDevelopment of femoral artery pseudoaneurysm (FAP) is described well in literature with a reported incidence of 0.2% for diagnostic and 0.8% for interventional transfemoral procedures 4, 5. In contrast, the real world incidence of radial artery pseudoaneurysm (RAP) is unknown, probably because of lower incidence and underreporting. During the period of 2003‐2015 in our institution we detected only 4 RAP cases out of 17,204 diagnostic and interventional transradial catheterization procedures (0.02%).'], hint: None\n",

However, large pseudoaneurysms which do not thrombose spontaneously, should be treated, because potential complications of RAP may be nearby venous compression, thromboembolism and rupture with significant bleeding requiring urgent surgery 6, 7. Until recently, the standard technique of treatment has been surgical repair including radial artery ligation, patch angioplasty using vein segment, RAP ligation and excision with end‐to‐end anastomosis 8, 9, 10. During the past decade several minimally invasive methods have been introduced that have largely replaced surgical treatment. Most common techniques are ultrasound‐guided compression 2, 11, 12 and percutaneous thrombin injection into RAP sac under ultrasound guidance 2, 13, 14.\\n\\nUltrasonographically guided compression is associated with a high success rate 11, 12, but this technique also has significant limitations, including decreased success rate for patients taking long‐term anticoagulation therapy 11, 15 and prolonged compression time, often resulting in patient discomfort and pain. Sometimes there are recurrences after compression therapy subsequently requiring further compression attempts or surgery 16. Moreover, pseudoaneurysm with relatively rigid fibrous wall require prolonged forceful compression that may cause occlusion of small caliber radial arteries, despite use ultrasound guidance, as cessation of radial artery flow during compression has been identified a risk factor for subsequent radial artery occlusion (RAO) 17, as well as prolonged compression of the artery 18.\\n\\nUltrasound‐guided thrombin injection is a quick and more effective technique in almost all cases even in patients with anticoagulation therapy. However, direct thrombin injection into pseudoaneurysm sac is not without risk. The unattended escape of thrombin into adjacent main artery can result in thromboembolism to the distal arterial bed, resulting in necrosis 19. In recent publication Zegri et al described a case of asymptomatic RAO after thrombin injection in RAP sac2. Teh et al described a case of thrombin injection into temporal artery pseudoaneurysm with unexpected outcome of seizure and scalp necrosis 6. In another publication D'Achille et al presented a case where thrombin injection in RAP sac led to distal skin changes suggesting distal vessel embolization after possible thrombin entry in arterial circulation 20. Other reported complications included anaphylaxis 21 or generalized urticaria after bovine thrombin injection and pseudoaneurysm rupture 19.\"], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: New technique for treatment of postcatheterization radial artery pseudoaneurysm., context: ['Taking into account all issues mentioned above, we decided to use of lumen‐based flow interruption in the RAP sac using insertion of 6F arterial sheath into radial artery covering the RAP neck and protected the radial artery against external compression related consequences, such as RAO. The stasis of blood in RAP sac facilitates thrombosis of the sac and resolution of pseudoaneurysm, without the need of external compression. Moreover, if needed we can safely inject thrombin into RAP sac after covering RAP neck by the sheath without the risk of thrombin entry into the arterial circulation.\\n\\nInitial angiography demonstrated significant deviation and stenosis of RA at the site of RAP and solely mechanical compression even ultrasound guidance did not guarantee radial artery patency and sheath was protected arterial lumen against external mechanical compression. In general, arterial sheath acts as a temporary covered stent, which can be removed after successful closure of RAP. Permanent covered stents has been utilized with good results in treatment of pseudoaneurysms of large caliber arteries 22, but in radial artery with mean diameter less than 2.5 mm, use of permanent covered stents may be risky. For prevention of radial artery closure after long dwell time of the arterial sheath, patent hemostasis technique should be used after sheath removal to prevent RAO 23.\\n\\nPossible contributing cause of RAP formation in our case was inadequate index hemostasis with an adverse influence of long‐term systemic anticoagulation therapy, which likely facilitated persistent communication between main artery and pseudoaneurysm sac. Earlier, Collins et al. noted that full anticoagulation therapy, rather than inadequate compression, was a potential contributing factor for development of RAP 8. While radial artery access is favored in such high risk patients to avoid bleeding complications, ongoing anticoagulation therapy may predispose to RAP formation. Prolonged non‐occlusive hemostatic compression, as well as other measures such as, use of smaller diameter introducer sheath, temporary interruption of anticoagulation therapy and surveillance for RAP (palpation of radial puncture site, ultrasound examination) during follow‐up after TRI procedure, may lower the incidence and aid in early detection of RAP.\\n\\nDespite the success of temporary radial artery occluding technique with arterial sheath for nonsurgical RAP treatment some questions remain and require further investigation, such as optimal sheath/radial artery diameter ratio, appropriate sheath dwell time in the artery for reliable RAP closure and monitoring after successful RAP closure.\\n\\nCONCLUSION'], hint: None\n",

This study was performed to investigate pediatric cases with P. jirovecii pneumonia in a single center.\\n\\n\\nMETHODS\\nWe identified pediatric patients younger than 19 years with microbiologically confirmed P. jirovecii pneumonia from January 2000 to February 2014. A retrospective chart review was performed.\\n\\n\\nRESULTS\\nFifteen episodes of P. jirovecii pneumonia in 14 patients were identified with median age of 8.3 years (range, 0.4-18.6 years). Among these patients, 11 patients had hematology-oncology diseases, 2 had primary immunodeficiency disorders (one with severe combined immunodeficiency and the other with Wiskott Aldrich syndrome), 1 had systemic lupus erythematosus and 1 received kidney transplant. Four patients were transplant recipients; 1 allogeneic and 2 autologous hematopoietic cell transplant and 1 with kidney transplant. The median absolute lymphocyte count at the diagnosis of P. jirovecii pneumonia was 5,156 cells/mm(3) (range, 20-5,111 cells/mm(3)).

Continuous efforts and more data are needed to identify high risk patients who may get benefit from P. jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nPneumocystis jirovecii is a common pathogen found worldwide in the lungs of mammals. In the 1980s, Pneumocystis rRNA and mitochondrial DNA had been analyzed, by which this organism was identified as a fungus1). P. jirovecii belongs to the genus of Pneumocystis and is a human specific pathogen2). Serologic surveys show that most humans are infected by 2–3 years old3). In the immunocompetent children, these infections are usually asymptomatic. However, P. jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) usually occurs in severely immunocompromised hosts34). Prematurity, malnutrition in infants, immunosuppressive treatment, transplantation, primary immunodeficiency disorders and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are well-known risk factors for PCP5). PCP in immunocompromised persons can be a life threatening infection. It has been reported that up to 43% of children with cancer developed PCP before the era of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) prophylaxis and nowadays its occurrence is much less with prophylaxis3). However, certain immunocompromised patients still develop PCP56). Therefore, we conducted this study to analyze pediatric cases with PCP in the Samsung Medical Center.\\n\\nMaterials and methods'], hint: None\n",

Over 2,000 pediatric immunocompromised patients were cared at our pediatric center. Patients with microbiologically confirmed PCP were identified. PCP was confirmed by direct fluorescent antibody from bronchial washing fluid or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in patients who were suspected to have PCP with pertinent clinical manifestation. The Institutional Review Board of Samsung Medical Center approved this study (approval number: 2015-02-067).\\n\\nResults\\nFifteen episodes of PCP were diagnosed in 14 patients. Among them 1 patient with severe aplastic anemia developed PCP twice at the age of 6 years and 16 years old.\\n\\nMedian age of the first PCP episode was 8.3 years (range, 0.4–18.6 years). Among these 14 patients, 10 patients (71.4%) had hematology-oncology diseases and two had primary immunodeficiency disorders (severe combined immunodeficiency and Wiskott Aldrich syndrome). One patient had systemic lupus erythematosus and the other received solid organ transplant. Four patients (26.7%) were transplant recipients; 1 allogeneic and 2 autologous hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients and one kidney transplantation recipient (Table 1). The main symptoms and radiology findings were shown in Table 2. Fever and dyspnea were the most common symptoms. Bilateral diffuse opacities were the most prominent radiologic finding (Table 2).\\n\\nIn 13 cases (13 of 15, 86.7%), patients were not receiving PCP prophylaxis within 1 month from the onset of PCP development. Median duration of last PCP prophylaxis to disease was 161.5 days (range, 1–493 days). Two patients developed PCP despite of prophylaxis. One patient with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) received PCP prophylaxis of pentamidine inhalation (TMP, 300 mg/dose) every month. The other patient with ALL received TMP/SMX prophylaxis (TMP, 120 mg/m2/day) on 2 consecutive days every week.\\n\\nFor treatment, TMP/SMX was given as a main therapeutic agent in all 15 episodes.

The first patient died 41 days after the diagnosis of PCP despite aggressive antimicrobial treatment and ventilator care in an intensive care unit (ICU). He also had coinfection with Acinetobacter baumanii pneumonia. The second patient was diagnosed with PCP twice in 2004 and 2014, respectively. He did not receive any prophylaxis before both episodes of PCP. The patient was recovered from the first episode of PCP after TMP/SMX and pentamidine combination therapy with steroid. Ten years later, he developed the second episode of PCP and was treated with TMP/SMX and caspofungin combination therapy with steroid. However, during this 2nd episode, the patient also had probable invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) and died of progressing respiratory failure. The third patient developed PCP 104 days after the 2nd allogeneic HCT despite prophylaxis. Unfortunately, he also had bacteremia due to vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE). He was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for VRE bacteremia and also for PCP but died. The forth patient was an infant with neuroblastoma. The patient was not receiving PCP prophylaxis according to the protocol. She developed persistent tachypnea with low oxygen saturation for which PCP was suspected later and she received empiric treatment for PCP with TMP/SMX. She received TMP/SMX and pentamidine combination therapy with steroid. However, her condition became deteriorated and she died 28 days after PCP confirmation from the lung tissue. The last patient had a hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. He was developed a PCP despite of prophylaxis. He died of respiratory failure after 8 days of TMP/SMX monotherapy.\\n\\nDiscussion\\nThis study analyzed 15 episodes of PCP in 14 pediatric immunocompromised hosts that occurred in a single center where over 2,000 of pediatric immunocompromised patients have been cared during these 14 consecutive years. Although PCP cases are rare events nowadays due to prophylaxis strategy, there is still a handful of patients who may develop PCP due to various reasons. Our data showed that in over 86.7% of cases (13 of 15), patients were not receiving PCP prophylaxis within 1 months from the onset of PCP development.

      "Predicting with title: Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in pediatric patients: an analysis of 15 confirmed consecutive cases during 14 years., context: ['In our study, we analyzed the reasons why prophylaxis was not performed in patients who developed PCP. Firstly, there were 2 patients with solid tumor who developed PCP during chemotherapy in which prophylaxis are not typically recommended. Secondly, there was 1 patient who developed PCP before the engraftment after HCT and did not have a chance to start PCP prophylaxis. Thirdly, there was one patient who developed PCP after the termination of recommended PCP prophylaxis period. Fourthly, in cases of primary immunodeficiency disorders, the 2 patients presented with PCP as one of the initial manifestations before being diagnosed with primary immunodeficiency disorders. Finally, there were patients who started PCP prophylaxis but stopped transiently with any reason, and did not resume prophylaxis properly even though the risk still existed.\\n\\nIt has been reported that non-HIV immunocompromised patients had more acute respiratory symptoms and needed more mechanical ventilator support than with those with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome7). Severe respiratory failure patients who needed the mechanical ventilator increased mortality rate up to 60% to 75%. Steroid is frequently used in PCP cases. However, unlike HIV patients in whom steroid use appeared beneficial8), there have been conflicting reports on steroid use in non-HIV patients with PCP9). Nine (9 of 15, 60%) of our patients also received steroid and all of the patients who needed ICU cared received steroid. Among the 9 patients treated with steroid, 3 patients (33.3%) died. In our study, due to the small number of PCP cases, we could not further investigate the effect of steroid in detail.\\n\\nThere are reports on efficacy of caspofungin for treating PCP cases10). In this study, 1 patient developed 2 episodes of PCP. For the first episode, he received TMP/SMX and pentamidine combination therapy with steroid and successfully recovered from the infection. For the second episode, he received TMP/SMX and caspofungin combination therapy with steroid but failed to recover from the infection and died of respiratory failure aggravation. It is not clear whether caspofungin was not efficacious in treating PCP in this patient because he also had IPA. In patients with a very serious condition who are failing on traditional medication, newer option would be needed.

      "Predicting with title: Cutaneous lymphangitis carcinomatosa made cervicofacial oedema intractable in a patient with superior vena cava syndrome., context: [\"Cutaneous lymphangitis carcinomatosa (CLC) is a rare form of cutaneous metastasis that causes lymphoedema and various eruptions. We report a case of lung cancer with CLC that caused both superior vena cava (SVC) stenosis and cervicofacial oedema, suggestive of SVC syndrome. A 64-year-old woman with lung adenocarcinoma presented with cervicofacial oedema and erythema, followed by severe dyspnoea 2 months after four cycles of carboplatin, pemetrexed and bevacizumab triplet therapy. Although chest CT indicated SVC stenosis, cervicofacial oedema remained despite treating the SVC stenosis via balloon dilation. A skin biopsy of the erythematic sample confirmed CLC as the cause of the patient's symptoms. CLC should be considered as a differential diagnosis of cervicofacial oedema in addition to SVC syndrome, especially when it is observed in combination with skin erythema and induration. Moreover, a skin biopsy should be performed promptly for accurate diagnosis of CLC and to decide on appropriate treatment.\\n\\nBackground\\nWhen lung cancer progression causes symptoms that reduce the ability to manage daily activities, adequate symptom treatment is required. Superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome is a major complication of lung cancer that occurs when the lung tumour compresses the SVC extrinsically, which causes cervicofacial oedema and dyspnoea.1 Among treatment options for SVC syndrome, an indwelling SVC stent effectively improves symptoms within a few days.1 Cutaneous lymphangitis carcinomatosa (CLC), a rare condition that accounts for less than 5% of cutaneous metastases, also causes cervicofacial oedema,2 and patients with CLC usually present with progressive lymphoedema and erythema.3 Here, we report a rare case of lung adenocarcinoma with CLC and SVC stenosis in a patient whose cervicofacial oedema and dyspnoea remained despite improving SVC blood flow via balloon dilation.\\n\\nCase presentation\\nA 64-year-old woman with a 20-pack-year smoking history presented with a persistent cough for 3 months.

This disease course is typical of SVC syndrome, which was the main cause of the symptoms. SVC syndrome arises from the compression of thin-walled SVC by enlarged paratracheal lymph nodes, mostly caused by lung cancer.1 The common symptoms of SVC syndrome include neck swelling, dyspnoea, facial swelling, cough and dilated chest collateral veins.1 Contrast-enhanced CT may elucidate the cause and extent of venous obstruction in SVC syndrome. The initial treatment in emergent cases of SVC syndrome is endovascular stenting of the SVC to restore flow. SVC stenting is reported to improve symptoms of SVC syndrome within 1–3 days, and recurrence rarely occurs.1 In the present case, SVC blood flow remained despite its prominent stenosis, and symptoms improved for only a few hours. The rapid recurrence of symptoms is atypical for SVC syndrome and indicates that there were other causes that made the patient’s symptoms more intractable.\\n\\nIn the present case, the patient presented with induration of the chest and abdomen, and a prompt skin biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of CLC. CLC is a rare form of skin metastases that exhibits extensive dermal and subcutaneous lymphatic invasion. This subcutaneous lymphatic invasion results in lymphoedema and diffuse skin erythema mimicking an infectious process, which differs from the typical form of cutaneous metastases such as nodules or masses.3–6 The incidences of cutaneous metastases in patients with metastatic cancer and with lung cancer are approximately 5% and 1.7%–3.1%, respectively; CLC accounts for approximately 5% of all cutaneous metastases.2 7 The most common histological feature observed in patients with lung cancer who develop CLC is adenocarcinoma, as in the present case.8 Cutaneous metastasis in lung cancer tends to occur in order in the anterior chest wall, back and abdomen.7 9–11 Cutaneous metastases are considered a late event in the evolution of the majority of malignancies.9 Lung cancer is the quickest to metastasise to the skin (15.75 months) among solid tumours.3 The average survival time from the appearance of CLC in lung cancer (less than 3 months) is shorter than that from the appearance of cutaneous metastasis (3 to 5 months).3 7 12 The only known treatment for CLC is systemic chemotherapy, but early diagnosis can lead to earlier anticancer treatment.8 Osimertinib may improve the prognosis of the patients harbouring the EGFR T790M mutation; however, osimertinib was not available for treatment at the time of this diagnosis.13–15 Supportive care for lymphoedema due to CLC, as follows, can improve patients’ quality of life and may even influence the progression of the disease: manual lymph drainage, compression therapy with bandages or special stockings, dermatological skin\\xa0care and psychological treatment.3'], hint: None\n",

Since then, only a few hundred cases have been reported. It was reported mostly in Asian patients as sporadic case reports and small case series [2]. Colorectal SRCC is very rare, comprising less than 1% of colorectal cancer (CRC) cases [3]. SRCC and mucinous adenocarcinoma (MAC) with signet cells are two overlapping entities. SRCC can occur within the pools of MAC or in a diffusely infiltrative process with minimal extracellular mucin in a linitis plastica [4]. On the other hand, the World Health Organization (WHO) defined MAC as a carcinoma confirmed by > 50% of extracellular mucin pools that contain malignant epithelial or individual tumor cells including SRCC [4]. SRCC mainly occurs on the right side of the colon [5]. The main differential diagnosis is metastatic gastric carcinoma with SRCC, and it is necessary to rule out this diagnosis by endoscopy before finalizing a diagnosis of primary colorectal SRCC. SRCC is associated with poor prognosis. Despite the rarity of SRCC, it is more frequently associated with patients with ulcerative colitis [6].

      "Predicting with title: A Rare Case of Signet Cell Carcinoma of Transverse Colon in a Young Patient With Ulcerative Colitis., context: ['CRC is the third most common cancer. In the USA, annually, approximately 145,600 new cases of large bowel cancer are diagnosed, of which 101,420 are colon and the remainder are rectal cancers [7]. Annually, approximately 50,630 Americans die of CRC, accounting for approximately 8% of all cancer deaths [6]. More than 90% of CRC cases are adenocarcinomas [8]; however, several histological variants have been distinguished such as mucinous, signet ring cell, medullary, adenosquamous, micropapillary, spindle cell and undifferentiated [8]. Signet cell carcinoma is a subtype of colon cancer. The name SRCC is a descriptive term describing a carcinoma cell retaining abundant intracytoplasmic mucin that causes the nucleus to be pushed to the periphery of the cell. In affected sites, the tumor infiltrates the entire wall, therefore results in a rigid and contracted structure called the linitis plastica [5]. The majority of these tumors arise in the stomach. However, it was also described in breast, lung, bladder, pancreas, gallbladder and the colon. It is a rare tumor comprising less than 1% of all CRC cases [2]. SRCC is predominant in males with a ratio of 2:1. Belli et al reported the most common location is the right side of the colon [9]. Our patient is a young man and had the tumor on the transverse colon. These tumors can be classified into either MAC with signet cell (a subtype of MAC) or SRCC. WHO definition of SRCC is carcinoma confirmed by > 50% of SRCC but states that SRCC can occur within the pools of MAC or in a diffusely infiltrative process with minimal extracellular mucin in a linitis plastica pattern [9]. Luis et al described in his retrospective study that 68.7% of SRCC cases occur in the right colon, 9.4% in the transverse and 21.9% in the left colon [5]. Our patient had the tumor on the transverse colon. Of the patients, 43.7% present with metastasis, whereas 64.3% of cases metastasize to the peritoneum, 46.5% present with lymph node metastasis (LNM) (mean of 14.3 positive lymph nodes), 62.5% with lymphovascular invasion and 25% with perineural invasion [5]. However, in the same study when SRCC was compared to MAC with signet cell, SRCC showed some distinctive characteristics. Patients presented a decade later (65 versus 56.5 years in comparison to MAC) as well as, in a higher clinical stage [5].\\n\\nThe pathogenesis of colorectal SRCC has not been fully understood yet. Tendon et al reported adenoma to carcinoma sequence for colorectal SRCC [10]. However, it is believed that SRCC may have a different mode of pathogenesis [11]. Hartman et al reported that precursor adenomatous lesions were more frequently observed in mucin-rich SRCC, and not in mucin-poor SRCCs [12]. There is an association between ulcerative colitis and SRCC. Colitis-associated carcinogenesis (CAC) leads to development of cancer through a different carcinogenic pathway known as the inflammation-metaplasia-dysplasia-carcinoma sequence with earlier identified molecular changes in TP531 [6].'], hint: None\n",

Together they represent about 30% of tumors with these genetic features [12]. The impact of MSI on survival in colorectal SRCC has not been confirmed to have a prognostic value on survival [12]. It is most likely due to small size of previous studies. Further research is required to confirm or reject this hypothesis [13]. In our patient DNA mismatch repair (MMR) protein analysis was performed. Analyses for MLH-1, MSH-2, MSH-6 and PMS2 were all normal. Mutations in the ras gene family (K-ras, H-ras and N-ras) are found in about 50% of CRCs. Ninety-five percent of ras mutations are identified at k-ras gene, with 80% at codon 12 and 15% at codon 13 [13]. There are limited data in the literature on ras gene mutations in colorectal SRCC.\\n\\nColitis-associated signet cell carcinoma in situ is associated with alterations of TP53 and CDH1 genes, resulting in a low expression of E-cadherin protein which impairs cell-cell adherence junctions and cell-proliferation signaling pathways. E-cadherin promoter methylation, the downregulation of E-cadherin expression, and aneuploidy have been frequently observed in ulcerative colitis-associated dysplasia [14].\\n\\nOur patient’s SRCC cells showed positive staining for CK20 and CDX2, and negative staining for CK7. MUC2 is negative and MUC5AC is positive in 41.7% of the cases. In our patient, intracytoplasmic mucin was positive for mucicarmine stain. MACs of the predominant signet ring cell type had the worst overall survival [15]. A high proportion of extracellular mucin and signet ring cell morphology in the non-mucinous component is also associated with poor overall survival [15]. Other negative prognostic factors include age older than 65 years, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), perineural invasion (PNI), advanced stage and an absence of MSI.'], hint: None\n",

Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody targeting CD 20 receptors on the membrane of B cells. In this case\\xa0report, we described a 79-year-old man who presented to our department with nausea, fatigue, and jaundice. Two months ago, he had received the last dose of the chemotherapy\\xa0regimen containing rituximab for follicular B cell lymphoma. Ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) scan of abdomen did not show any focal lesions. Liver function tests showed worsening hepatic failure and viral serology demonstrated active HBV infection. Antiviral therapy with entecavir and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate failed to improve his symptoms, and he died of fulminant hepatic failure. Rituximab targets CD 20 receptors positive B cells. It can destroy both cancerous and normal B cells. A decline in immune function can activate occult HBV infection. Prior to initiation of rituximab therapy, screening should be conducted in all cases for HBV associated serological markers. Patients with active or occult HBV infection must be started on appropriate antiviral therapy to prevent any severe outcomes with rituximab-containing regimens.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nIn 1997, rituximab was approved for medical use and to treat non-Hodgkins B cell lymphomas. It is listed as one of the most effective and safest medicines in the health system. It binds to CD 20 receptors on B cells, leading to the destruction of B cells including both the normal and cancerous cells [1]. It is especially used to treat diseases which have a high number of B cells or are characterized by abnormal B cells. By eliminating abnormal B cells, it allows the body to make normal and healthy B cells.\\xa0Normal B cells are rapidly depleted from the peripheral blood and remain depleted until nearly six months post-treatment, followed by a slow recovery [2].

      "Predicting with title: Acute Megakaryoblastic Leukemia Developing as Donor Cell Leukemia after Umbilical Cord Blood Transplantation., context: ['A 64-year-old man with acute myeloid leukemia underwent umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT). After 11 months of complete remission (CR) following UCBT, the bone marrow showed 7.5% myeloblasts. CR was obtained after a single course of azacitidine monotherapy, but the myeloblasts gradually increased in the blood. We made a diagnosis of acute megakaryoblastic leukemia derived from donor cell with a fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of the sex chromosomes and an immunophenotypic analysis. Azacitidine was administered again and produced a therapeutic effect of stable disease. This case suggests that azacitidine may be a useful therapy for patients with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia in situations in which intensive chemotherapy and transplantation are not indicated.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nAcute megakaryoblastic leukemia has been described as a subtype of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) (1) and was incorporated into the French-American-British (FAB) classification of AML as M7 (2). The associated bone marrow characteristics include the proliferation of abnormal megakaryoblasts identified by the presence of platelet-specific surface glycoprotein and frequently extensive myelofibrosis. Histopathologic evidence of M7 AML itself is an independent poor prognostic factor for the overall survival (3).\\n\\nAzacitidine, a demethylation agent, has demonstrated a significant survival benefit in patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) relative to conventional care and has also been proved effective in older patients with newly diagnosed AML with >30% blasts (4,5). However, whether or not azacitidine is effective for acute megakaryoblastic leukemia is unclear, as it is rare in adults.\\n\\nNo reports are available on acute megakaryoblastic leukemia developing as donor cell leukemia (DCL) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and treatment with hypomethylating agents (azacitidine or decitabine). We herein report a case of acute megakaryoblastic leukemia developing as DCL after umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) that was treated with azacitidine.\\n\\nCase Report\\nA 64-year-old man had pancytopenia and was referred to our hospital (Table 1). An analysis of bone marrow aspirate revealed that myeloblasts comprised 49.5% of nucleated cells with multilineage dysplasia, so we made a diagnosis of AML with myelodysplasia-related changes. He achieved hematological complete remission (CR) after induction chemotherapy consisting of idarubicin and cytarabine and underwent UCBT with a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen from an unrelated female donor in first CR 8 months after the initial diagnosis.\\n\\nTable 1.

We made a diagnosis of molecular relapse of the original disease and reduced the dose of the immunosuppressive agent.\\n\\nThereafter, complete donor chimerism was achieved, and hematological remission was sustained for 11 months.

However, a FISH analysis before azacitidine monotherapy showed that 100% of the bone marrow cells had XX signals; therefore, we considered this to be a case of donor-derived hematologic malignancy. On day 27 of azacitidine monotherapy, a bone marrow examination revealed hematological CR. He was followed up as an outpatient without additional treatment; however, the blasts eventually reappeared and gradually increased in the peripheral blood with the elevation of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. On day 97 of azacitidine therapy, we conducted a bone marrow biopsy because of a dry tap in the bone marrow aspirate and found that myeloperoxidase-negative blasts had invaded the bone marrow (Fig. 2). An immunophenotypic analysis by FCM showed the expression of CD7, CD21, CD33, CD34, CD38, CD56 and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR on the leukemic blasts. The blasts showed a normal female karyotype in a G-banding chromosomal examination. Another FISH analysis showed that 100% of the bone marrow cells had XX signals again.

He underwent L-asparaginase (L-ASP) monotherapy (6,000 IU/m2 on days 1-7), which caused febrile neutropenia and severe liver damage. After L-ASP monotherapy, we re-examined the surface markers of the leukemic cells by FCM, which showed positivity for CD41, as well as CD7, CD21, CD33, CD34, CD38, CD56 and HLA-DR (Fig. 3). This result led us to diagnose his DCL as acute megakaryoblastic leukemia rather than M/NKPAL.\\n\\nFigure 3. A flow cytometric analysis of DCL at the diagnosis of acute megakaryocytic leukemia.

Following a single course of azacitidine, the number of abnormal blasts and amount of WT-1 mRNA in the peripheral blood were almost unchanged, but the patient's overall condition improved with a mild decrease in LDH levels; he continued to receive treatment with azacitidine alone as an outpatient. He underwent red blood cell transfusions regularly, but no severe adverse events such as febrile neutropenia were observed during azacitidine monotherapy. He demonstrated disease progression four months after azacitidine monotherapy. He underwent low-dose combination chemotherapy and gemtuzumab ozogamicin monotherapy, but they were ineffective and caused severe myelosuppression and sepsis. He ultimately died of brain hemorrhaging 28 months after UCBT.\\n\\nDiscussion\\nAcute megakaryoblastic leukemia can develop as DCL after allogeneic HSCT. Table 3 shows the main characteristics of the original leukemia and donor cell leukemia in our report. HSCT is an effective treatment for many hematologic malignancies, but disease relapse remains a major cause of post-transplant mortality (6). DCL is de novo leukemia developing in donor-derived hematopoietic precursor cells and is a rare but severe complication after allogeneic HSCT. The incidence of DCL may have been underestimated because clinicians do not perform thorough examinations to distinguish between recipient-derived cells and donor-derived cells in cases of leukemia developing after HSCT. DCL has become well known, and a number of reports of DCL have been published in recent years (7-9). It is important to distinguish DCL from relapse of original diseases when patients develop leukemia mimicking the original diseases after allogeneic HSCT, especially in cases where a decision regarding treatment for the leukemia must be made.\\n\\nTable 3.

Compared to relapsed disease, which almost always occurs within 2 years post-transplant, DCL is commonly diagnosed later, with a median time to DCL of 31 months (range: 2-312 months) (10). Shiozaki et al. reported that the characteristics of DCL occurring after UCBT were different from those occurring after bone marrow transplantation (BMT), including the duration of time between transplantation and the occurrence of DCL, and the types of abnormal karyotypes (11). DCL occurred within a significantly shorter period after UCBT than after BMT, with a median duration of 14.5 months for UCBT and 36 months for BMT. The frequency of monosomy 7 observed in DCL after UCBT was significantly higher than that in DCL after BMT. Greaves reported that up to 5% of CB samples might harbor potentially pre-leukemic clones, raising the possibility that DCL might be disproportionately common after UCBT (12). It has been reported that risk factors for DCL include the use of cells obtained from elderly donors and cells obtained from cord blood (13). In our case, the use of cord blood for the cell source was a risk factor for developing DCL as well as for the early occurrence of DCL.\\n\\nAzacitidine may be effective for treating acute megakaryoblastic leukemia.

      "Predicting with title: Molecular classification of tissue from a transformed non-Hogkin's lymphoma case with unexpected long-time remission., context: ['BACKGROUND\\nThe concept of precision medicine in cancer includes individual molecular studies to predict clinical outcomes. In the present N\\xa0=\\xa01 case we retrospectively have analysed lymphoma tissue by exome sequencing and global gene expression in a patient with unexpected long-term remission following relaps. The goals were to phenotype the diagnostic and relapsed lymphoma tissue and evaluate its pattern. Furthermore, to identify mutations available for targeted therapy and expression of genes to predict specific drug effects by resistance gene signatures (REGS) for R-CHOP as described at http://www.hemaclass.org. We expected that such a study could generate therapeutic information and a frame for future individual evaluation of molecular resistance detected at clinical relapse.\\n\\n\\nMETHODS\\nThe patient was diagnosed with a transformed high-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma stage III and treated with conventional R-CHOP [rituximab (R), cyclophosphamide (C), doxorubicin (H), vincristine (O) and prednisone (P)]. Unfortunately, she suffered from severe toxicity but recovered during the following 6 months\\' remission until biopsy-verified relapse. The patient refused second-line combination chemotherapy, but accepted 3 months\\' palliation with R and chlorambucil. Unexpectedly, she obtained continuous complete remission and is at present\\xa0>9\\xa0years after primary diagnosis. Molecular studies and data evaluation by principal component analysis, mutation screening and copy number variations of the primary and relapsed tumor, identified a pattern of branched lymphoma evolution, most likely diverging from an in situ follicular lymphoma. Accordingly, the primary diagnosed transformed lymphoma was classified as a diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) of the GCB/centrocytic subtype by \"cell of origin BAGS\" assignment and R sensitive and C, H, O and P resistant by \"drug specific REGS\" assignment. The relapsed DLBCL was classified as NC/memory subtype and R, C, H sensitive but O and P resistant.\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nThorough analysis of the tumor DNA and RNA documented a branched evolution of the two clinical diagnosed tFL, most likely transformed from an unknown in situ lymphoma. Classification of the malignant tissue for drug-specific resistance did not explain the unexpected long-term remission and potential cure. However, it is tempting to consider the anti-CD20 immunotherapy as the curative intervention in the two independent tumors of this case.\\n\\nBackground'], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: Molecular classification of tissue from a transformed non-Hogkin's lymphoma case with unexpected long-time remission., context: ['Follicular lymphoma (FL) is a low-grade non-Hodgkin’s type lymphoma with a median survival of 8–10\\xa0years [1, 2]. It can evolve into the more aggressive histology of transformed FL (tFL) [3], resembling diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), but share a distinct gene expression profile and immunophenotype with the primary FL [4–8]. This transformation occurs by the expansion of one or more subclones with loss of the follicular growth pattern resulting in a rapidly progressive clinical course refractory to treatment and with inferior prognosis. To distinguish between progression and transformation of FL a biopsy for histological examination is needed in case of symptoms and CT verified tumor progression. The histological verified presence of both follicular and diffuse architecture in the initial diagnostic biopsy represents a finding that implies early transformation of FL [2, 3]. The survival post-transformation ranges between median 7–20\\xa0months [9, 10].\\n\\nSimilar to progression, the transformation is a clonal evolution from an ancestral clone that initially arises from a common normal cell of origin (COO) through linear or branched outgrowth of an existing subclone, deregulated by random genetic or epigenetic hits.\\n\\nOur knowledge of genetic aberrations in FL has dramatically increased over the last few years, and recent comprehensive studies by exome sequencing has identified the mutational landscape and the genetic changes that contribute to the step wise tumor progression, including transformation to DLBCL [4–8, 11–18].\\n\\nHere we report a unique, biopsy and histology verified case of primary tFL with relapse and long-term remission following palliation therapy. As molecular studies of such unexpected outcome may be informative, we decided to study the two malignant tissue biopsies and a germ line DNA sample to thorough analysis with the aim to identify differences in an attempt to understand and explain the clinical outcome.\\n\\nThe case will also illustrate the molecular technologies, knowledge and competences that are increasingly available to challenge the “one size fits all” approach to early clinical phase I–II drug trials in relapsed patients and replace this with a predictive strategy. We envisage that therapies will be stratified to reflect disease heterogeneity, in a departure from the current use of non-precise chemotherapeutic agents and allow for the development of new taxonomy and companion diagnostics—a clear need in future clinical care.\\n\\nCase presentation'], hint: None\n",

A computed tomography (CT) was performed as part of the initial diagnostic work-up and revealed a bulky retroperitoneal tumor measuring 13.5\\xa0×\\xa012\\xa0×\\xa07.5\\xa0cm. Pathologically enlarged lymph nodes were also detected in all supra- and infra-diaphragmatic stations and the spleen was enlarged (Additional file 1: Figure S1A, July, 2007). Furthermore, she had bilateral hydronephrosis.\\n\\nA tumor biopsy from an axillary lymph node was performed. Morphological examinations revealed a picture typical for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), but with nodular areas consistent with an underlying follicular lymphoma. The cells were monoclonal IgM+, kappa+, CD20+, CD19+, CD10+, CD38+, CD79A+, BCL2+ and BCL6+, CD30− with a high Ki67-estimated sproliferation rate. On the basis of these findings a diagnosis of DLBCL transformed from follicular lymphoma was made. The routine bone marrow biopsy and aspiration was clear for signs of lymphoma infiltration. The disease was categorized as stage III according to the Ann Arbor classification based on the extensive nodal involvement on both sides of the diaphragm.\\n\\nA combined modality treatment with six cycles of R-CHOP (Rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin (hydroxydaunomycin), vincristine (oncovin) and prednisolon) followed by consolidating radiotherapy against the abdominal bulk tumor was planned. Unfortunately, her treatment was complicated by severe infectious episodes including septicemia. After the final R-CHOP cycle, she had lost an additional 10\\xa0kg and was in a clinical poor performance status. An 18F-FDG positron emission tomography/CT (PET/CT) performed at this point showed a residual PET-negative tumor mass surrounding the aorta (Additional file 1: Figure S1B, January, 2008). As a result of her poor condition she entered post-therapy follow-up without receiving the planned radiotherapy.\\n\\nA routine PET/CT study performed after three months of follow-up confirmed continues remission (Additional file 1: Figure S1C, March, 2008). However, a routine PET/CT study performed 6 months into the follow-up period revealed clear progression of the retroperitoneal tumor in terms of increased size and FDG-uptake (SUVmax 11.2) (Additional file 1: Figure S1D, July, 2008).

Ten genetic subtypes of this autosomal recessive condition have been described to date. Some patients with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type 1, 4, or 6 develop Crohn's-like inflammatory bowel disease at any age including early childhood, but most often in adolescence or young adulthood. Here we report infantile-onset of inflammatory bowel disease in a patient with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type 1 who responded to infliximab.\\n\\n\\nMETHODS\\nA Japanese boy, the second child of non-consanguineous healthy parents, was born with chalky white skin, silvery-white hair, and gray eyes, representing oculocutaneous albinism. He developed frequent diarrhea and fever accompanied by weight loss at 6\\u2009months, and was diagnosed with Crohn's-like inflammatory bowel disease based on the endoscopic finding of longitudinal ulcerations in the colon and the histopathologic finding of nonspecific chronic inflammation without granulomas at the age of 11\\u2009months.

Currently, at 22\\u2009months of age, the patient is in sustained clinical remission, receiving only IFX (7\\u2009mg/kg) every 8\\u2009weeks.\\n\\nBecause of albinism, nystagmus, and IBD, an association suggestive of HPS, platelet morphology was evaluated. Electron microscopy showed absence of dense bodies in platelets, which was consistent with a diagnosis of HPS. Following parental informed consent, we performed genetic screening using next-generation sequencing in a targeted gene panel analysis for primary immunodeficiency disease and/or IBD including HPS1, HPS4, and HPS6 genes (Additional file 1) [1, 4]. We identified 2 heterozygous mutations in the HPS1 gene in the patient (c.398\\u2009+\\u20095G\\u2009>\\u2009A and c.1323dupA) and a heterozygous mutation in each parent (father, c.398\\u2009+\\u20095G\\u2009>\\u2009A; mother, 1323dupA). These mutations have been reported previously in Japanese patients with HPS-1 [5]. We diagnosed the patient with HPS-1 resulting from compound heterozygous mutation of the HPS1 gene.\\n\\nDiscussion and conclusions\\nHPS can be caused by 10 different genotypes involving various chromosomes. These aberrant genes cause abnormal vesicle formation involving melanosomes, platelet dense bodies, and a subset of lysosomes. This results in visual impairment, skin hypopigmentation, and increased risk of bleeding [1, 3]. IBD has been reported in patients with HPS-1, −\\u20094, and\\u2009−\\u20096; the pathogenetic mechanisms are unknown [1, 2].\\n\\nIBD in HPS shows many of the same pathologic features as the more common Crohn’s colitis: irregular distribution of large bowel lesions, interspersed with regions of normal mucosal architecture; superficial crypt abscesses; and prominent inflammatory cell infiltrates in involved areas [2, 6, 7]. In a study of 122 subjects with HPS, 8% overall were found to have IBD; among those with gastrointestinal symptoms, 33% were diagnosed with IBD [2]. IBD in HPS can present at any age including early childhood but most commonly becomes evident in adolescence and young adulthood.

      "Predicting with title: Infantile-onset inflammatory bowel disease in a patient with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome: a case report., context: ['In some patients with HPS, conventional therapy of IBD including aminosalicylates and corticosteroids has been unsuccessful. Recent reports maintain that immunosuppressants and anti-tumor necrosis factor α therapy such as IFX may be effective for IBD in patients with HPS [2, 6, 7]. Use of compounds containing 5-aminosalicylic acid is an area of controversy because of the HPS platelet storage pool defect [1]. In fact, our patient is now in sustained clinical remission with colonic mucosal healing using only IFX.\\n\\nPatients with a diverse spectrum of rare genetic disorders can present with IBD, a situation referred to as monogenic IBD [4, 8, 9]. Patients with these disorders often develop symptoms during infancy or early childhood, along with endoscopic or histologic features of Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, or unclassified IBD. HPS is considered one of the monogenic IBDs [1, 2, 8]. Distinguishing monogenic forms among IBD patients under 6\\u2009years old can be crucial in determining the best treatment. Genetic screening using next-generation sequencing is a highly useful approach to diagnosis of patients with monogenic IBD [4, 8, 9]. In this patient, the clinical features of oculocutaneous albinism with nystagmus are consistent with an underlying diagnosis of HPS [1]. Such characteristic features may aid in diagnosing specific etiologies of infantile-onset IBD. Our patient represents a case in point; we diagnosed him with HPS-1 by genetic analysis as an infant and could treat him successfully with early introduction of IFX.\\n\\nIn conclusion, we consider our patient to be the first known HPS-1 patient with infantile-onset of IBD.

Among these cancers, non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 40–50% of cases that include LM.1, 2 In recent years, the incidence of LM in patients with NSCLC has increased, especially in EGFR+ NSCLC patients, and 9.0% of EGFR+ NSCLC patients were diagnosed with LM.3, 4, 5 Whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT), systemic chemotherapy, and intrathecal chemotherapy (ITCT) are the traditional treatment choices for NSCLC patients with LM. However, there is no consensus on the optimal treatment strategy, and the efficacies of these treatments for LM patients remain unsatisfactory. Presently, LM is still closely associated with a poor prognosis and rapid deterioration in clinical situations. Therefore, the goal of LM treatment is to improve or stabilize neurological symptoms, which can improve quality of life and lead to improved survival rates.'], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: Prognostic significance of molecular characteristics of cerebrospinal fluid for non-small cell lung cancer patients with leptomeningeal metastasis., context: ['An increasing number of reports have shown that NSCLC patients with EGFR gene mutations (EGFR+) tend to have more central nervous system (CNS) metastases, including both brain and leptomeningeal metastases after using of EGFR‐tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in association with theuse of EGFR‐tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). There are several potential reasons for this phenomenon. Firstly, the survival of EGFR+ NSCLC patients has been significantly prolonged.6 Secondly, first (i.e. gefitinib) and second‐generation (afatinib) EGFR‐TKIs have poor penetration across the blood–brain barrier (BBB). The percentage of penetration ranges from 0.69% to 1.3%, which may provide a good opportunity for tumor cell growth in the CNS.7 Thirdly, as the treatment duration increases, the likelihood of the development of several secondary resistance mechanisms to EGFR‐TKIs also increases.8, 9, 10 Based on these considerations, the treatment options for EGFR+ NSCLC patients with LM generally include an intial high‐dose of first or second‐generation EGFR‐TKIs, or a switch to a different EGFR‐TKI.\\n\\n\\nEGFR mutations can be detected by analyzing circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in both plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which provides an alternative to tumor biopsies for further study. With the widespread use of third generation EGFR‐TKIs, data on LM in NSCLC patients with EGFR+ is relatively scarce. We retrospectively assessed the diagnosis, treatment modes, and survival status of EGFR+ NSCLC patients with LM that had been enrolled in our hospital. We determined their gene mutation status by analyzing ctDNA extracted from peripheral blood, CSF, and tumor tissue samples.\\n\\nMethods\\nPatient population\\nIn this retrospective study, EGFR+ NSCLC patients diagnosed with advanced‐stage (stage IV) NSCLC between January 2016 and November 2018 were reviewed for diagnosis of LM. All LM patients needed to be diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or by the detection of malignant cells in the CSF by cytopathological diagnosis. In the event that only atypical and/or suspicious cells were found in the CSF, patients were not diagnosed with LM.\\n\\nAll patients signed informed consent to participate in this study and gave permission to use their peripheral blood and CSF.

Apoptosis and cell necrosis due to cumulative dose effect and direct action on myocardial cell, leads to progressive cardiovascular disease[4]. \\n\\nLV dysfunction appearance may vary from one chemotherapy agent to another. For anthracyclines, this may occur immediately after exposure or later on[5]. However, the heart has significant cardiac reserve, and the expression of cardiac damage may be symptomatic when a substantial amount of myocardial reserve has been exhausted. Therefore, heart damage may become obvious after years or even decades from anthracyclines cancer treatment[6].\\n\\nAlthough epirubicin is less cardiotoxic than doxorubicin, Ryberg et al have reported that developing congestive HF risk in a 40 year old woman treated with 800 mg/m2 of epirubicin was estimated to be 5% [7].

As a learning point from this case, we would like to highlight the importance of a thorough clinical examination of patients with sepsis with no obvious source. As in this patient, the presenting complaint was diarrhoea, which was actually a manifestation rather than a cause for sepsis and clearly had a hidden diagnosis, which could have been missed if the patient was not adequately exposed.\\n\\nDiscussion\\nNecrotising fasciitis was first been described in soldiers during the American Civil war in the eighteenth century. This condition has been known by various names including phagadena gangrenosum, Meleney’s gangrene, Fournier’s gangrene (necrotising fasciitis of the perineum). The term necrotising fasciitis was first coined in 1952 by American Surgeon B Wilson.\\n\\nNecrotising fasciitis is classified into three types based on the organisms involved. Type I is polymicrobial, type II is monomicrobial and type III by a specific pathogen namely marine Vibrio species (V. vulnificus). Bacteria associated with type I are a combination of gram-positive cocci (streptococci and staphylococci), gram-negative species (Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas and Klebsiella) and anaerobic organisms like Bacteroides and Clostridia [1].\\n\\nNF is a rapidly progressing bacterial infection involving the subcutaneous tissues. The bacteria produce endotoxin and exotoxin [2] that leads to micro-vascular thrombosis [3], tissue ischaemia and liquefactive necrosis. This causes a systemic illness [4] often progressing to septic shock, multi-organ dysfunction and death. The condition is resistant to antimicrobial therapy due to poor drug penetration, hence leaving surgical debridement as the primary treatment option [5].'], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: Necrotising fasciitis: a fatal case of sepsis and a diagnostic challenge - case report and review of literature., context: ['Previously reported predisposing factors included rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, type 2 diabetes mellitus, renal transplantation, chronic renal failure, injection IV drug use, immunosuppressive therapy and intramuscular injection with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Other factors include trauma, burns, insect bite, chronic skin ulcers and postoperative wound infection. Of these, type 2 diabetes is the commonest underlying medical condition and multiple needle punctures in IV drug users is the commonest trauma predisposing to NF [6].\\n\\nThe clinical picture and presentation of the patient may vary and hence can pose a diagnostic challenge at an early stage and hence requires a very high index of suspicion. The most common early signs are local erythema, warmth, induration, oedema and pain, which are also present in conditions like cellulitis and septic arthritis and hence the diagnostic dilemma. However, pain out of proportion to clinical signs associated with septic shock or failure to respond to broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics should alert the clinician to possible NF. Patches of skin necrosis, crepitus and bullae with compromised haemodynamic status are alarming signs.\\n\\nUltrasound, CT or MRI scan can be done in suspicious cases. Wong et al. [7] devised the Laboratory Risk Indicator for Necrotising Fasciitis (LRINEC) score, which is a valuable diagnostic tool to distinguish necrotising fasciitis from non-necrotising skin infections. LRINEC score ≥\\u20096 had a positive predictive value of 92% in high-risk patients according to this study.

Surgical exploration can also establish the diagnosis of NF. The operative findings of greyish necrotic deep fascia, lack of resistance to blunt dissection, lack of bleeding of the fascia and presence of foul-smelling ‘dishwater’ pus aids in the confirmation of the diagnosis.

In previously described cases of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) associated with secondary ITP, treatment has consisted of nephrectomy, splenectomy, and corticosteroids. Here, we describe a case of metastatic RCC presenting with a right ventricular mass and subsequent development of secondary ITP. The clinical course was complicated by recurrent severe thrombocytopenia despite treatment with corticosteroids, rituximab, and thrombopoietin receptor agonists, precluding cancer-directed therapy and anticoagulation. Further study is needed to determine the optimal management strategy for malignancy-associated ITP.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nImmune thrombocytopenia (also referred to as immune thrombocytopenic purpura or ITP) is an autoimmune bleeding disorder characterized by isolated low platelet counts resulting from pathologic immune-mediated mechanisms. It occurs as a result of antibody-mediated targeting of platelet antigens in the setting of normal erythrocyte and leukocyte function without evidence of impaired bone marrow production. ITP is a common cause of thrombocytopenia in both children and adults, with an estimated incidence of 1.9–6.4 per 100,000 children/year and 1.6–3.9 per 100,000 adults/year [1]. Primary ITP is a diagnosis of exclusion, where no disorder or medication associated with thrombocytopenia is identified, whereas secondary ITP refers to thrombocytopenia attributable to an underlying disease or the development of drug-induced thrombocytopenia [2].\\n\\nAlthough secondary ITP is more commonly associated with rheumatologic disorders, infections, and hematologic malignancies, it is also seen in patients with solid tumor malignancies, with the highest reported cases in lung and breast cancers [3]. Approximately 20% of patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) experience some form of a paraneoplastic syndrome; however, secondary ITP associated with RCC is rare [4]. Removal of the primary tumor, corticosteroids, and splenectomy have been used to treat RCC-associated ITP with variable success [3]. Further, clinical data supporting effective therapies for patients with malignancy-associated ITP who are not surgical candidates is lacking. In this report, we describe a challenging case of secondary ITP in a patient with advanced RCC.\\n\\nCase Presentation\\nA 47-year-old female with a past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, depression, and tobacco use presented with chest pain and hemoptysis. Computed tomography (CT) angiogram revealed a large thrombus extending from the right ventricular (RV) cavity into the main pulmonary artery with additional bilateral segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli and evidence for right heart strain. Anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin was initiated, and the patient was transferred to a tertiary medical center for further management.'], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: Secondary Immune Thrombocytopenia in Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma: A Case Report and Discussion of the Literature., context: ['Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed a large RV mobile thrombus (2.4 × 1.5 cm) extending from the right ventricle through the outflow tract into the main pulmonary artery with associated moderate RV systolic dysfunction. She subsequently underwent intracardiac tumor resection, pulmonary artery embolectomy, and tricuspid valve ring repair. Surgical pathology demonstrated unorganized to early organizing thrombus with prominent clusters of highly atypical cells with enlarged nuclei and atypical mitotic figures. Immunohistochemistry was positive for pancytokeratin, PAX-8, and CD10. Overall, the findings were consistent with a cytologically high-grade, pleomorphic tumor favoring metastatic RCC. Follow-up TTE revealed continued moderate RV systolic dysfunction though significant decrease in the size and mobility of the RV mass. Her postoperative course was complicated by anemia and volume overload. She was transitioned from unfractionated heparin infusion to warfarin and aspirin prior to discharge.\\n\\nAbdominal CT scan obtained as an outpatient revealed a 9.9-cm left renal mass, multiple associated enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes, moderate pericardial effusion, nodular and peripheral wedge-shaped opacities in the lung bases concerning for metastatic disease or pulmonary infarcts, and small right greater than left pleural effusions with pleural thickening concerning for malignant effusions.\\n\\nShe was re-admitted after a syncopal event, and chest CT revealed multiple bilateral pulmonary emboli and a 5.5 × 3.0 cm RV mass with severely reduced RV function. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed multiple cortical 2–3 mm foci of enhancement involving the bilateral frontal lobes concerning for metastases. Abdominal MRI was notable for retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy and increasing size (10.1 × 7.6 × 10.8 cm; Fig. 1) of the left renal mass without evidence of invasion of surrounding organs. Anticoagulation was continued on admission given concern that the pulmonary emboli in part were related to bland thrombus formation in addition to tumor emboli. Further cardiac surgery, vascular surgical intervention, or nephrectomy were determined to be unsafe. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) was considered for the brain metastases but was deferred during the admission due to the small size of the lesions. She was discharged on anticoagulation with an outpatient plan for SRS and consideration for starting systemic therapy for advanced RCC.'], hint: None\n",

Anticoagulation was held and she was hospitalized for evaluation of the new-onset severe thrombocytopenia. Workup revealed negative heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)-PF4 antibody test, negative heparin-induced platelet aggregation assay, and normal ADAMTS13 activity. Peripheral blood smear revealed occasional schistocytes; however, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) was felt to be unlikely based on absence of clinical evidence for DIC and a normal fibrinogen level. Given concern for secondary ITP as a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with RCC, dexamethasone 40 mg daily was started for 4 days along with subcutaneous romiplostim (1 μg per kg weekly), a thrombopoietin mimetic used in treating ITP that stimulates bone marrow production of platelets by megakaryocytes [5].\\n\\nShe achieved a partial response with improvement in platelet count to 76 × 109/L after 4 days of dexamethasone and a single romiplostim treatment (Fig. 2). Severe thrombocytopenia recurred within 2 days of completion of dexamethasone. Prednisone 80 mg daily was started and the dose of romiplostim was increased to 3 μg/kg for the next dose (week 2 of treatment); and the platelet count stabilized at 55 × 109/L. The hospital course was complicated by development of a left upper extremity proximal deep vein thrombosis. Anticoagulation with low-dose enoxaparin 30 mg twice daily was initiated but was periodically held during the hospitalization for platelet counts less than 40 × 109/L. At discharge, enoxaparin was increased to 40 mg twice daily, romiplostim 4 μg/kg was administered, and prednisone was decreased to 60 mg daily. Outpatient plans were made to progressively increase romiplostim dosing and taper prednisone to maintain platelet counts high enough for anticoagulation without the need for steroids if possible, in order to receive systemic therapy for metastatic RCC.\\n\\nAt a 1-week follow-up appointment, the platelet count increased to 148 × 109/L. Enoxaparin was increased to 60 mg twice daily and prednisone dose taper was initiated. RCC-directed treatment was initiated with axitinib, a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, with plans to start pembrolizumab, a programmed death 1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, following SRS for brain metastases and completion of the prednisone taper. Ten days after starting axitinib, follow-up brain MRI prior to SRS demonstrated at least 15 new brain metastases. Whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) was planned instead of SRS, and axitinib was discontinued. Additionally, her platelet count decreased to 52 × 109/L with prednisone having been tapered to 10 mg daily while on weekly romiplostim (2 μg/kg). Prednisone was increased to 20 mg daily, and repeat platelet count the following week was further decreased to 23 × 109/L.

Evaluation in the emergency department included chest CT angiogram which demonstrated increased size of the RV mass (9.1 × 4.3 cm; Fig. 3) with increased significant narrowing of the RV outflow tract, pulmonary emboli similar to the prior scan with a new filling defect of the left lower lobe concerning for additional new pulmonary embolism focus, and a new filling defect in the left inferior pulmonary vein concerning for thrombus. Abdominal/pelvic CT performed concurrently was notable for redemonstration of the large left renal mass with increased retroperitoneal adenopathy. Platelet count was further decreased to 15 × 109/L. She received intravenous fluids and methylprednisolone 125 mg and was admitted to the medical intensive care unit. Dexamethasone 40 mg daily was resumed and romiplostim 4 μg/kg was continued weekly. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was considered at this time but was deferred based on thrombogenic concerns.\\n\\nGiven severe thrombocytopenia precluding systemic therapy and enlargement of the RV tumor thrombus, palliative radiation therapy was planned for the heart and left kidney (30 Gy each) in addition to WBRT (35 Gy). TTE revealed progression of the RV mass to completely fill the RV cavity and cause both RV inflow and outflow obstruction along with flattening of the interventricular septum. Based on continued severe thrombocytopenia and an inability to distinguish her progression of pulmonary emboli as secondary to bland thrombi versus intravascular tumor emboli, anticoagulation was felt to confer more risk than benefit and was held.\\n\\nFollowing minimal response to 4 days of dexamethasone 40 mg daily, second-line treatment with rituximab 375 mg/m2 weekly was added along with increasing romiplostim dosing to 6 μg/kg weekly.

Standard initial therapy for primary ITP consists of corticosteroids (high-dose dexamethasone or prednisone), IVIG or IV anti-D immunoglobulin (anti-D), with combination treatment and platelet transfusions used for emergent bleeding [6]. While these initial therapies may produce a complete response (CR) as defined by platelet count ≥100 × 109/L and absence of bleeding [2], additional courses of corticosteroids for relapses are often necessary [6]. IVIG and anti-D are used as adjunctive treatments for patients without significant response to corticosteroids or as primary treatment for patients with a contraindication to corticosteroid use [6].'], hint: None\n",

The development of a Bullous pemphigoid (BP)-like blistering disease, driven by autoantibodies against the hemidesmosomal protein BP180, is a potentially serious irAE whose incidence seems to be increasing. We therefore set out to characterize the clinical and (immuno)histopathological features and treatment responses of cases of BP which developed during or after CI therapy collated in six German tertiary referral centers between 2014 and 2018. We identified twelve cases of BP which emerged during and/or after CI therapy. The time interval between the initiation of CI therapy and the diagnosis of BP was 3-74 weeks (median: 23 weeks). Age at the time of diagnosis of BP varied between 62 and 80 years (median: 76 years). The clinical presentation of the patients was diverse but the severity was relatively mild when compared to that seen in most cases of spontaneous BP. Only four patients met all of the immunopathological criteria recommended in the European guidelines for the diagnosis of BP. Topical corticosteroid treatment was sufficient to achieve disease control in most patients. CI therapy could be continued in 8 out of 12 patients. In summary, our study indicates that cases of BP during or after CI therapy bear several peculiarities distinguishing them from spontaneous BP. Given the diversity of the clinical presentation of CI-induced BP the application of existing diagnostic algorithms developed for spontaneous BP can be utilized to uncover the frequency and features of CI-induced BP and to develop and optimize management algorithms.\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nCheckpoint inhibitors (CIs) constitute a new class of immunomodulatory drugs which block co-inhibitory signals on immune effector cells and result in the generation of potent T-cell mediated immune responses. Among the CIs which are currently licensed are monoclonal antibodies which target the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) or the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) pathway. For example, the first-in-class drug ipilimumab inhibits CTLA-4, nivolumab and pembrolizumab inhibit PD-1, and atezolizumab and durvalumab target the PD-1 ligand PD-L1 (1). The advent of checkpoint inhibitors has revolutionized the treatment of solid cancers. Initially licensed for the treatment of metastatic melanoma, CIs are employed in an ever increasing number of cancer entities, including Merkel cell carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, urothelial bladder cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and Hodgkin’s lymphoma (1).'], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: Retrospective Analysis of Checkpoint Inhibitor Therapy-Associated Cases of Bullous Pemphigoid From Six German Dermatology Centers., context: ['Given that the CTLA-4 and PD-1 pathways play a central role in regulating cellular immune responses, removal of this control mechanism can result in both generalized and tissue-specific inflammation. These inflammatory responses are collectively termed “immune-related adverse events” (irAEs), and include, but are not limited to, dermatitis, colitis, hypophysitis, hepatitis, and nephritis (1). The skin is the most frequently affected organ, with up to 50% of patients receiving CIs developing skin-related irAEs.\\n\\nThe clinical presentation of cutaneous irAEs is remarkably diverse. Commonly presenting with a non-specific maculopapular rash accompanied by pruritus, they may also present with lichenoid, eczematous, granulomatous, lupus-like, or erythema multiforme-like skin changes and/or vitiligo (2).\\n\\nMost intriguingly, there is a growing body of literature which reports the development of the antibody-driven autoimmune disease bullous pemphigoid (BP), the most common disease of the group of pemphigoid diseases, in the context of treatment with immune CI (2–8).\\n\\nThe hallmark of BP is the development of autoimmunity against type XVII collagen (BP180) (9). BP presents clinically with the development of widespread urticarial plaques (pre-bullous phase), which evolve into blisters and erosions (10, 11). However, non-bullous and atypical variants of BP also exist. In these variants, patients exhibit localized blister formation with minimal or absent inflammation of the surrounding skin. Additionally, BP may present with predominantly eczematous (including dyshidrosiform) and subacute prurigo-like skin changes (12). Indeed, BP may exist in the absence of skin changes, with the only symptom being widespread, intractable itch. Given the wide spectrum of clinical symptoms and signs in BP, the disease can neither be reliably diagnosed nor excluded based on the clinical presentation alone. The European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) guidelines recommend that the diagnosis of BP should be based on both the clinical findings and (immuno)pathological investigations of the patient’s skin, both lesional and perilesional, and serum (12). Central to establishing the diagnosis of BP is the demonstration of linear depositions of autoantibodies, which are in most cases predominantly of the IgG immunoglobulin class, and/or of complement factor 3 (C3) at the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ) of perilesional skin (12). As the deposition of autoantibodies and/or complement at the DEJ is the defining feature of all pemphigoid diseases and as the clinical features of BP may overlap with those of other pemphigoid diseases, the clear distinction of pemphigoid diseases requires the detection of autoantibodies in the serum and a determination of their antigen specificity. This is achieved by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy on NaCl-split human skin, which detects the presence of autoantibodies against proteins of the dermal-epidermal junction, and by ELISA biochip-based techniques, and/or immunoblot assays to pinpoint th'], hint: None\n",

Serological examination alone is not sufficient to diagnose BP given that autoantibodies are reportedly undetectable in the serum of up to 20% of BP patients, but are present in the serum of 0.5% of healthy individuals (12, 13). Histopathologically, an early blister exhibits a subepidermal cleft combined with a dense dermal inflammatory infiltrate mainly consisting of eosinophils and neutrophils. However, the histopathological examination is also non-specific and is therefore not suitable alone to confirm the diagnosis (14).\\n\\nThe complexity and heterogeneity of both BP and cutaneous irAEs means that a comprehensive clinical, serological, and (immuno)histopathological work-up is central to correctly diagnosing suspected cases of BP during or after CI therapy. In the present study, we retrospectively profiled twelve cases of CI-associated BP diagnosed in six German Dermatology centres and contrasted their features with previously reported cases of both immune-checkpoint mediated and spontaneous BP.\\n\\nMethods\\n\\nWe systematically searched the clinical records of patients treated with CIs between 2014 and 2018 in six German Dermatology centres for the diagnosis of BP.

Fluorescein angiography (FA) showed fluorescein leakage in the macular and midperipheral area. After treatment with oral acetazolamide (250\\xa0mg/day) for one month, CME was completely resolved, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) improved from 20/50 to 20/25, and FA examination showed decreased dye leakage in the macular and midperipheral areas.\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nIn cases of vision loss in HCQ retinopathy, it is important to consider not only progression of maculopathy, but also development of CME, which can be effectively treated with oral acetazolamide.\\n\\nBackground\\nHydroxychloroquine (HCQ) retinopathy is a form of retinal toxicity caused by HCQ and is characterized classically as a bilateral bull’s-eye maculopathy, in which there is a ring of parafoveal retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) depigmentation with sparing of the fovea. HCQ retinopathy can accompany other retinal complications such as cystoid macular edema (CME) and epiretinal membrane [1]. Specifically, CME is the result of fluid accumulation in the outer plexiform layer in the macular area and leads to central visual loss.\\n\\nSeveral treatment modalities have been shown to be effective for CME combined with other retinal diseases. In eyes with combined CME and retinitis pigmentosa, treatment with oral or topical acetazolamide can produce successful resolution of CME and functional improvement according to previous studies [2–7]. Although the pathogenic mechanism of CME in HCQ retinopathy has not been elucidated, oral or topical acetazolamide may also be useful in the treatment of CME in HCQ retinopathy. Here, we report a case of CME in HCQ retinopathy that improved with the use of oral acetazolamide. Using multimodal imaging modalities, we explored the detailed retinal structural changes, and discussed the possible mechanisms of CME in HCQ retinopathy.\\n\\nCase presentation'], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: The effect of oral acetazolamide on cystoid macular edema in hydroxychloroquine retinopathy: a case report., context: ['A 60-year-old woman visited our clinic complaining of blurred vision in both eyes. The patient had been diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and had taken HCQ for the past 20\\xa0years. Her daily dose of HCQ was 400\\xa0mg, and her total cumulative dose was estimated to be 2920\\xa0g. The patient had first come to our clinic 7\\xa0months prior, at which time her best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/30 in both eyes and fundus examination showed bilteral midperipheral retinal degeneration. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) showed defects in the paracentral photoreceptor layers. Consistent with this finding, a visual field test revealed dense paracentral ring scotoma with decreased foveal sensitivity in both eyes (Fig. 1). The patient reported no family history of eye diseases and no visual symptoms before the initiation of HCQ therapy, and she had no auditory symptoms. At that time, the patient was diagnosed with HCQ-induced retinal toxicity, HCQ retinopathy, and HCQ treatment was discontinued. Four months later, BCVA was maintained as 20/30 in both eyes.Fig. 1 Diagnosis of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy based on visual field examination, optical coherence tomography, and fundus autofluorescence. a Humphrey 30-2 visual field test shows dense paracentral ring scotoma with decreased foveal sensitivity in both eyes. b Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) demonstrates defects in the paracentral photoreceptor layer. c Fundus autofluorescence reveals decreased paracentral and mid-peripheral fluorescence in both eyes\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDuring the patient’s visit of visual complaint, slit lamp examination showed no specific findings and there was no inflammation in the anterior chamber or vitreous cavity; however, her BCVA had declined to 20/50. SD-OCT examination showed the presence of a cystoid space within the inner retina and fluorescein angiography (FA) showed leakage in the macular area, a presentation typically associated with cystoid macular edema (CME), as well as diffuse leakage in the midperiphery (Figs. 2 and 3). Central macular thickness (CMT) was 245\\xa0μm and 335\\xa0μm in the right and left eyes, respectively.

      "Predicting with title: The effect of oral acetazolamide on cystoid macular edema in hydroxychloroquine retinopathy: a case report., context: ['After treatment with oral acetazolamide for one month, CME was resolved in both eyes on SD-OCT images (Fig. 2). CMT was decreased from 245 to 177\\xa0μm and from 335 to 146\\xa0μm in the right and left eyes, respectively. BCVA was improved to 20/25 in both eyes. Follow-up FA showed decreased dye leakage in both the macular and mid-peripheral areas (Fig. 3).\\n\\nDiscussion\\nHCQ retinopathy presents with initial photoreceptor damage in a classic parafoveal distribution, known as a “bull’s eye” pattern, which corresponds to parafoveal scotomas upon visual field examination [8, 9] and parafoveal thinning of the outer nuclear layer with breakup of the ellipsoid zone and interdigitation zone lines on SD-OCT. [10] However, recent studies have shown that the initial pattern of damage in Asian eyes is more frequently in the more peripheral extramacular area near the arcades, as a pericentral pattern [11, 12]. In this pattern of retinopathy, CME may threaten relatively preserved central vision, leading to deterioration of visual function.\\n\\nCME can develop in various retinal disorders [13]. Macular edema associated with chloroquine (CQ) retinopathy is relatively rare, and it was reported in 5 of 78 patients during a study period from 1957 to 1979 [14]; however, its treatment has not been discussed extensively. Although some cellular and molecular factors have been elucidated, the precise mechanisms for the formation of CME are unknown, including for HCQ retinopathy. In retinitis pigmentosa, CME formation has been suggested to involve breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier (BRB) as a result of chronic, low-grade inflammation [15–21] and decreased fluid transport efficiency of the retinal pigment epithelium [3]. CME associated with HCQ retinopathy has been reported in both leaking [22] and non-leaking [23] forms. In this case, it can be assumed that the leaking form of CME occurred owing to a mechanism such as BRB breakdown due to HCQ damage and that CME developed because such damage was not recovered even after the drug was cut off; however, the precise mechanism should be revealed in future studies.\\n\\nIn the present case, the CME associated with HCQ retinopathy exhibited diffuse leakage on FA that resolved with oral acetazolamide as evidenced by decreased fluorescein leakage. Acetazolamide reduces macular edema and improves visual acuity in some patients with macular edema related to certain inflammatory and degenerative eye diseases, including chronic iridocyclitis and retinitis pigmentosa [4]. With respect to mechanism, acetazolamide has been suggested to stimulate outward active transport and passive permeability across the BRB [6, 24, 25]. More specifically, acetazolamide blocks the active transport of certain ions (HCO3-, Cl-) across the retinal pigment epithelium [26], and also hastens the rate of resorption of subretinal fluid [27]. In our patient, acetazolamide was thought to induce functional recovery of the BRB, leading to a reduction in diffuse leakage and also improvement of CME.'], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: The effect of oral acetazolamide on cystoid macular edema in hydroxychloroquine retinopathy: a case report., context: [\"Use of topical dorzolamide or oral acetazolamide (250\\xa0mg/day) in patients with CME in HCQ retinopathy has been described in only one recent study [1], which reported limited benefit. However, the patients in that study also had epiretinal membrane, which may have limited the beneficial effects of acetazolamide on reducing macular edema. Aside from carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, other treatment options for CME with HCQ retinopathy such as triamcinolone or anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibodies have not been described in the literature. In our case, there were no accompanying structural alterations to the central macular area such as epiretinal membrane, which likely explains why acetazolamide was effective for anatomic and functional improvement of CME.\\n\\nRetinitis pigmentosa associated with various types of mutations shows similar features to advanced HCQ retinopathy; therefore, retinitis pigmentosa should be carefully assessed for the differential diagnosis in patients taking HCQ medication. In the present case, the patient reported no family history of eye diseases and no visual symptoms before the initiation of HCQ therapy and she had no auditory symptoms. Genetic analyses on the associated mutations might be helpful for ruling out the possibilities of retinitis pigmentosa; however, we believe that the baseline (at the time of HCQ initiation) full-field electroretinography (ERG) and/or multifocal ERG may be very suggestive for the differential diagnosis.\\n\\nConclusion\\nIn conclusion, this case suggests that oral acetazolamide is an effective treatment for CME associated with HCQ retinopathy. Further prospective and comparative studies with a larger population are needed to assess the efficacy and safety of this treatment in patients with CME secondary to HCQ retinopathy.\\n\\nAbbreviations\\nBCVABest corrected visual acuity\\n\\nBRBBlood-retinal barrier\\n\\nCMECystoid macular edema\\n\\nCMTCentral macular thickness\\n\\nCQChloroquine\\n\\nFAFluorescein angiography\\n\\nHCQHydroxychloroquine\\n\\nRPERetinal pigment epithelium\\n\\nSD-OCTSpectral-domain optical coherence tomography\\n\\nSLESystemic lupus erythematosus\\n\\nThis study received no specific grant from any funding agency.\\n\\nFunding\\nNo funding was obtained for this study.\\n\\nAvailability of data and materials\\nAll data supporting our findings are provided in the manuscript.\\n\\nAuthors’ contributions\\nEHH, SJA, HWL and BRL contributed to conception and design, data acquisition, interpretation of data, and EHH and SJA drafted the article and all authors approved the final version.\\n\\nEthics approval and consent to participate\\nThe local ethics committee ruled that no formal ethics approval was required in this case report.\\n\\nThe authors declare that they adhered to the CARE quidelines/methodology.\\n\\nConsent for publication\\nWritten informed consent for publication of potentially identifying information and clinical images was obtained from the patient.\\n\\nCompeting interests\\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\\n\\nPublisher's Note\"], hint: None\n",

Severe ocular complications appear in less than 1% of the patients and require early treatment. We present the case of a patient diagnosed with a BRAF mutated metastatic melanoma. Ocular pain and a blurred vision appeared after treatment and the patient visited the ophthalmology emergency room, where he was diagnosed with acute anterior uveitis (AAU), synechiae, and bilateral papillitis. The patient was treated with topical corticosteroids, prednisone, and mydriatics, which immediately improved the patient's status. Therefore, when an ocular inflammatory disease exists, immune checkpoint inhibitor treatments must be ruled out as possible causes.\\n\\nPembrolizumab is a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody that is selective against the PD-1 receptor on the cell surface. It is used in the treatment of unresectable metastatic melanomas. The response rate of this treatment is about 40%.[1] Although the frequency of adverse effects is high, in majority of the cases these are mild and easily treated.[23] These side effects are known as immune-related adverse events because they are caused by the lack of inhibition of T lymphocytes.\\n\\nOcular complications appear in less than 1% of the patients and are severe and require early treatment.[1]\\n\\nCase Report\\nA 38-year-old male, Caucasian, diagnosed with a BRAF-mutant melanoma with locoregional recurrence, a satellite nodule, and adenopathies. Treatment with pembrolizumab was initiated. After 6 cycles of treatment, the patient began to experience ocular pain and blurred vision for which he visited the ophthalmology emergency room of the hospital, where he was diagnosed with AAU with synechiae and bilateral papillitis. He had a visual acuity (VA) of 20/20, Tyndall +++ in the right eye (OD) and Tyndall++++ in the left eye (OS) with multiple inferior iridocrystalline synechiae in both eyes (OU) and no hypopyon. Edema of the bilateral papilla without vitritis was observed in the fundoscopy [Fig. 1]. Treatment with dexamethasone eye drops and 40 mg of prednisone every 24 hours was initiated in the emergency room. Cyclopentolate, tropicamide, and phenylephrine eye drops were also prescribed to break the synechiae. The examination after 24 hours revealed Tyndall++ in OD and Tyndall + in OS and no synechiae were found. There was an improvement of the bilateral papillitis. The oncologist in charge of the patient and an ophthalmologist expert in uveitis considered the pembrolizumab to be the primary cause of ocular inflammation since the mechanism of action of the drug can induce ocular inflammation and there are similar cases reported in the literature. They discontinued the treatment with pembrolizumab because of grade 3 ocular toxicity and was replaced by vemurafenib and cobimetinib. A head CT scan was performed without any relevant findings.\\n\\nFigure 1 Bilateral papillitis\"], hint: None\n",

The oral prednisone was lowered to 30 mg/day for a week. The results of the assessment a week after the episode was Tyndall+ in OD and Tyndall+/- in OS and an improvement of disc edema. An optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the layer of the nerve fibers was performed to assess the edema [Fig. 2]. After this examination, a treatment plan was set up which consisted of reducing the topical corticoids and prednisone until their elimination. The patient was reassessed after a month, with the following outcomes 20/20 VA OU, no Tyndall or synechiae, and normal papillae [Figs. 3 and 4]. The patient continues receiving check-ups every 4 months by the ophthalmologist. Moreover, 2 years after the pembrolizumab was stopped, no similar episodes have been observed in this patient.\\n\\nFigure 2 OCT: showing disc edema at presentation\\n\\nFigure 3 OCT: showing improvement in disc edema after treatment\\n\\nFigure 4 Resolved disc edema\\n\\nDiscussion\\nFew cases found in the literature describe the association of pembrolizumab with anterior uveitis but only one case associated it with bilateral papillitis.[45] In the present case report, we have included new evidence for the association of the use of pembrolizumab with the development of anterior uveitis and papillitis.\\n\\nThe activation of T cells is the principal immunological mechanism against cancer. To avoid activating the immune system, T cells have receptors that inhibit activation. Two of these receptors are CTLA-4 and PD-1. The metastatic cells of the melanoma are capable of expressing ligands for these receptors and hence, inhibit the activation of the immune system. Ipilimumab was the first of this family of drugs known as an immune checkpoint inhibitor, which acts by inhibiting the ligands of the CTLA-4 tumor cells and therefore T cells proliferate, invade the tumor cells, and help in the process of regression. Pembrolizumab acts in the same way but on PD-1 ligands.[6]\\n\\nThe mechanism that explains the development of ocular inflammation during the use of pembrolizumab is as follows: The presence of PD-1 ligand in ocular cells has been demonstrated and it is believed that the expression of these PD-1 ligands mediates in the ocular inflammation by inhibiting the proinflammatory cytokines produced by T cells. Thus, it is believed that the presence of PD-1 inhibitors can contribute to the development of ocular inflammation.[1]'], hint: None\n",

The patient was discharged with full recovery.\\n\\n1. Introduction\\nAmlodipine, a dihydropyridine group of calcium channel blockers (CCBs), constitutes the leading form of cardiovascular drug overdose and has been implicated in several deaths resulting from such overdose [1, 2]. It has half-life of 30–50 hours with a large volume of distribution (21 liter per kilograms) [1]. It has also a low metabolic clearance with the advantage of using a once-daily dosage [3].\\n\\nTreating patients with amlodipine overdose can be challenging [4]. Patients severely poisoned can develop profound refractory bradycardia, hypotension, acute kidney injury, and either cardiogenic or noncardiogenic pulmonary edema [5].\\n\\nHere we report a case of amlodipine overdose with noncardiogenic pulmonary edema without refractory hypotension and bradycardia which was managed supportively.\\n\\n2.

She denied concomitant consumption of alcohol or any other drugs. Comprehensive toxicology analysis of urine was negative for opioids, morphine, alcohols, amphetamines, and so forth. There were no signs of head trauma or focal neurologic signs. She was hospitalized in an intensive care unit with respect to high toxic ingestion. Routine laboratory tests on admission were as follows: white blood cells (12.6 × 109 per liter; normal range: 4–10 × 109 per liter); 90% neutrophil; serum urea (BUN) 21 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL); creatinine (Cr) 1.6\\u2009mg/dL; serum calcium 8.4\\u2009mg/dL; phosphorus 5.8\\u2009mg/dL; and glucose plasma level 184\\u2009mg/dL.

The patient received dexamethasone (8\\u2009mg, three times daily), ipratropium bromide inhalation aerosol (three milliliter vial, three times daily), and pulmicort inhalation (one milligram per day). The results regarding the vital signs, O2 saturation, VBG, BUN, and Cr during hospitalization in an intensive care unit have been reported in Tables 1 and 2. Chest X-ray on day three showed typical batwing appearance without cardiomegaly which was suggestive of ARDS.\\n\\nAfter 11 days of hospitalization she was extubated and transferred to the ward. She underwent psychiatric evaluation and was discharged without any complications.\\n\\n3. Discussion\\nThere are no standardized guidelines for managing severe amlodipine intoxication because of limitation in the number of describing surveys [4, 6–10].\\n\\nGastrointestinal decontamination in amlodipine overdose is beneficial when used within the one hour of consumption [11]. Also activated charcoal had been effective when given during the first 24 hours after drug ingestion [12]. In our case gastrointestinal decontamination for three hours and activated charcoal for 11 hours after ingestion were started.\\n\\nDifferent pharmacologic therapies available for amlodipine overdose with persistent hypotension or myocardial depression include inotropic support with adrenergic agents, glucagon, IV infusion of calcium, hyperinsulinemia-euglycemia therapy, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in refractory shock [4, 7, 10, 11, 13]. In this case, she had mild hypotension without cardiac conduction defects; therefore, she received only crystalloid and dopamine infusion and stabilized in a short time period.\\n\\nOur patient developed noncardiogenic pulmonary edema on day three. Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine that selectively blocks L-type calcium channels in smooth muscle and myocardial depressant activity at toxic levels so patients may present with cardiogenic pulmonary edema [13, 14]. Some studies also reported cases with catastrophic shock and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema [9, 10, 15]. The mechanism of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema in patients with CCB overdose is not well known. Excessive pulmonary capillary transudation due to selective precapillary vasodilatation causes an increase in transcapillary hydrostatic pressure and ultimately interstitial edema [16, 17].'], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: Noncardiogenic Pulmonary Edema after Amlodipine Overdose without Refractory Hypotension and Bradycardia., context: ['In our case severe hypotension was not observed, so interstitial edema may be caused by other ways such as blocking other types of calcium channels, the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme system effects [18, 19], or P-glycoprotein-mediated transport [20]. Also cardiac ejection fraction was 60%; therefore, fluid overload could not be reason of pulmonary edema. Considering age, sex, serum urea, creatinine level, and glomerular filtration rate, she suffered from mild and transient kidney injury. So kidney injury could not be reason of pulmonary edema.\\n\\nSevere CCB poisoning is often associated with significant hyperglycemia due to L-type calcium channel in pancreatic β-cells [21], as well as dysregulation of the insulin-dependent or phosphatidylinositol three-kinase pathway [22]. However, in this case glucose plasma levels were between 151 and 184\\u2009mg/dL for initial four days that may show a role in the ultimate degree of toxicity.\\n\\nAnother finding in this case was the development of mild respiratory and metabolic alkalosis. However, metabolic acidosis has been reported in most of the reported cases [5–16]. Metabolic acidosis could be resulting from systemic hypotension and acute kidney injury.\\n\\nARDS manifests with diffuse alveolar inflammation and increased pulmonary vascular permeability resulting in hypoxemia [23].

There was disease progression despite therapy with mycophenolate and intravenous immunoglobulin. Serial intravitreal injections of triamcinolone resulted in restoration of photoreceptor anatomy on optical coherence tomography and visual improvement. The patient's vision was preserved at 20/40 OD and 20/32 OS until his death from lung cancer 31\\xa0months after CAR diagnosis.\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nIntravitreal triamcinolone may be beneficial for maintenance of vision in patients with CAR.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nCancer-associated retinopathy (CAR) is a paraneoplastic process caused by autoantibodies against retinal proteins, including recoverin and alpha enolase [1, 2]. Approximately 50\\u2009% of patients with CAR present with visual symptoms before the diagnosis of a malignancy is made [3]. CAR is rare, and there are currently no standard treatment regimens for the condition [4]. Systemic corticosteroids, steroid-sparing immunosuppression, and non-traditional immunomodulatory therapies including intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) have been shown to variably preserve or improve vision [5–7]. Cystoid macular edema (CME) has been reported in patients with non-paraneoplastic autoimmune retinopathy (npAIR) but is less common with CAR [2]. We report a patient with CAR in whom serial intravitreal steroid injections resulted in maintenance of visual function for more than 2\\xa0years until his death.\\n\\nCase report\\n\\nA 67-year-old man presented with decreased vision, photopsias, and nyctalopia. Examination revealed best corrected visual acuities of 20/32 in the right eye and 20/25 in the left eye. Dilated fundus exam was remarkable for bilateral CME and arteriolar narrowing (Fig.\\xa01a). Fluorescein angiography (FA) revealed petalloid leakage at the fovea, perivascular leakage, and disk staining bilaterally (Fig.\\xa01b). Multifocal and full-field electroretinography (ERG) revealed severely decreased scotopic and photopic responses but no negative ERG pattern. Serologic testing revealed the presence of antibodies to a 46-kDa retinal protein that was confirmed to be alpha enolase. Systemic evaluation for malignancy uncovered poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Chemotherapy was initiated with carboplatin and paclitaxel. For his eye disease, the patient was initially treated with intravenous methylprednisolone, 1\\xa0g/day for 3\\xa0days, followed by oral prednisone (initial dose of 80\\xa0mg/day and then a taper over 2\\xa0months) with decreased retinal vascular leakage and CME.Fig. 1 a Fundus photos showing macular edema and arteriolar narrowing. b Fluorescein angiography showing petalloid leakage in the macula, perivascular leakage, and disk staining\"], hint: None\n",

Steroid-sparing treatment was attempted first with mycophenolate mofetil (2\\xa0g/day) and then with four doses of IVIg, with no response to either therapy. FA continued to show CME and diffuse retinal vasculitis. Intravitreal triamcinolone (IVTA) was administered bilaterally, with vision improving to 20/40 OD and 20/32 OS and resolution of cystic changes. Over the ensuing 2.5\\xa0years, the patient received four additional IVTA injections bilaterally. When the IVTA effect waned, his vision diminished to as low as 20/70 in the right eye and hand motions in the left eye. After the initial injection, there were no retinal cystic changes or significant retinal thickening on optical coherence tomography (OCT) at the subsequent visits, yet the patient periodically reported visual deterioration and had objectively diminished visual acuity with disruption of photoreceptor anatomy on OCT (Fig.\\xa02a). The vision and anatomical changes improved with IVTA (Fig.\\xa02b). His visual acuities were 20/40 OD and 20/32 OS after the most recent IVTA injections.

      "Predicting with title: Intravitreal triamcinolone for cancer-associated retinopathy refractory to systemic therapy., context: ['This report describes the successful treatment of CAR with intravitreal steroids. The treatment of CAR is often challenging. Treatment of the underlying malignancy alone does not alter the course of the ocular disease. Various treatment modalities have been tried in patients with CAR, including oral and intravenous steroids, plasmapheresis, IVIg, rituximab, azathioprine, cyclosporine, and mycophenolate mofetil [2, 6–8]. Despite treatment with these systemic medications, it is not unusual to have a progressive decline in vision with this disease. Our patient responded initially to systemic steroids but did not have an alteration of his disease course with mycophenolate mofetil or IVIg. After initiation of IVTA injections, his vision improved. Vision improvement in CAR is unusual; vision stabilization is often the best that can be hoped for. In this patient, there was strong evidence for a causal relationship between the injections and visual improvement. When the intravitreal triamcinolone wore off, his vision declined. With his initial injections, the improvement in vision could be attributed, at least in part, to treatment of the CME. But subsequent injections were given when there were no retinal cystic changes or thickening present on OCT and yet reinjection led to marked subjective and objective improvement. The improvement was likely due to suppression of inflammation around the photoreceptors as evidenced by restoration of inner segment/outer segment junction and resolution of hyperreflective lesions along the photoreceptor layer on OCT after the injections. In one such instance, his vision recovered from hand motions to 20/32 OS.'], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: Intravitreal triamcinolone for cancer-associated retinopathy refractory to systemic therapy., context: ['CME and periphlebitis can be seen in patients with npAIR but is less common with CAR. There is one case report of retinal periphlebitis associated with CAR in a patient with ovarian cancer [9]. In the presence of CME, intravitreal steroids have previously been shown to be effective in patients with npAIR [2]. The unique presentation of CAR with CME and vasculitis in our patient motivated the use of intraocular triamcinolone, but there was evidence for an effect on the course of CAR directly given the visual improvements even when IVTA injected in the absence of CME. The presence of anti-retinal antibodies in the sera of patients with CAR suggests the need for systemic intervention in general, but this patient’s course suggests that a subset of CAR patients might be successfully treated with local therapy. The OCT photoreceptor findings in this patient pre- and post-injection indicate that intravitreal steroids may be able to successfully suppress inflammation and apoptosis induced by the autoantibodies at the level of the photoreceptors despite ongoing systemic production and/or circulation of antibodies. Some authors caution that readministration of intravitreal steroid for recurrent CME in npAIR and CAR is best done early when cystic changes are just starting to recur to avoid cycles of retinal cyst expansion and collapse which may cause retinal damage [2, 10]. Similarly, CAR patients without CME being treated with intravitreal steroids should be followed closely with OCT imaging and retreated promptly when evidence of photoreceptor layer disruption becomes apparent to avoid permanent photoreceptor damage.\\n\\nIn summary, intravitreal steroids should be considered in patients with CAR who do not respond to systemic therapy. In our patient, serial IVTA injections led to preservation of vision for almost 3\\xa0years.\\n\\nOpen Access\\n\\nThis article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License which permits any use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author(s) and source are credited.'], hint: None\n",

Patients with severe mental illness have a higher risk of developing the condition compared to the general population. Methods: We observed 10 cases of VTE in patients with mental illness who were treated with the antipsychotic drug olanzapine. The diagnosis of VTE was made at the University Hospital Hradec Kralove (UH HK) from 2004 to 2013. VTE was objectively determined by imaging techniques (duplex ultrasonography, CT angiography) and laboratory tests (D-dimer). The average age was 46 years. The clinical manifestation of VTE was deep vein thrombosis in nine cases, including one case of simultaneous pulmonary embolism and one case of a concurrent ischemic cerebrovascular accident (iCVA). None of our patients had a history of malignant disease, trauma, or surgery. Results: Apart from antipsychotic medication, all the patients had clinical or laboratory risk factors for VTE. The most frequent clinical risk factors were obesity (n = 7) and smoking (n = 6). The most frequent laboratory risk factors were increased levels of FVIII (n = 4), mild hyperhomocysteinemia (n = 3), and factor V Leiden mutation (n = 2). VTE developed within 3 months after antipsychotic drug initiation in three patients and within 6 months in three patients. Conclusion: Olanzapine can be considered a precipitating factor for VTE formation. When olanzapine is administered, we need to monitor for clinical signs and symptoms of VTE, especially when other risk factors are present.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nVenous thromboembolism (VTE) is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition. Manifestations of VTE include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). VTE is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Considerable amounts of money are also spent on the treatment of VTE in the developed countries of Europe and North America. VTE affects approximately 1.0–1.8 people per 1,000 annually (1, 2). The incidence rises exponentially with age, and the risk significantly increases in people over the age of 40 years (3). Multiple risk factors are involved in the development of VTE. VTE risk factors can be divided into physiological and pathophysiological, clinical and laboratory, and congenital and acquired factors (\\nTable 1\\n) (1, 2, 4).\\n\\nTable 1 Risk factors for VTE [adapted from Refs. (1, 2, 4)].\\n\\nCongenital\\tAntithrombin deficiency\\t\\nProtein C deficiency\\t\\nProtein S deficiency\\t\\nFactor V Leiden mutation\\t\\nFactor II mutation\\t\\nAcquired\\tIncreasing age\\t\\nMalignancy\\t\\nAntiphospholipid syndrome\\t\\nInflammatory bowel disease\\t\\nSystemic lupus erythematosus\\t\\nNephrotic syndrome\\t\\nOverweight and obesity\\t\\nMicroalbuminuria\\t\\nExternal\\tInfectious disease\\t\\nSurgery, trauma, immobilization\\t\\nPregnancy and puerperium\\t\\nOral contraceptives\\t\\nHormonal replacement therapy\\t\\nAntipsychotic drugs\\t\\nAir transport (long haul)\\t\\nMixed\\tHigh factor VIII levels\\t\\nAPC resistance\\t\\nHyperhomocysteinemia\\t\\nHigh factor IX levels\\t\\nHigh factor XI levels\\t\\nFibrinolysis abnormalities'], hint: None\n",

The risk of thrombosis rises significantly when multiple factors occur together. In older patients, acquired risk factors occur more frequently, which explains the significantly increased incidence of VTE in the elderly population.\\n\\nThe pathophysiological mechanism underlying VTE formation is the development of a relative thrombophilic state. This involves a shift in the hemostatic system towards thrombosis. If a genetic disposition is prominent in the etiopathogenesis of VTE, patients are determined to have hereditary thrombophilia. If external risk factors prevail, the condition is determined to be an acquired hypercoagulable state. A hypercoagulable state may result from the presence of any of the conditions belonging to the so-called Virchow triad (venous stasis, hypercoagulability, and vessel wall damage) (1, 2).\\n\\nIn patients with a mental illness, the risk of VTE is increased for several reasons. In a previous study, we found significantly increased activation of markers of thrombogenesis (sP-selectin, D-dimer, FVIII) in untreated patients experiencing a first episode of psychosis compared to healthy volunteers (5). The markers of thrombogenesis continued to be elevated after 1 year of treatment (6). Antiphospholipid antibodies (APAs), especially anticardiolipin antibodies (ACLAs), may serve as a marker of autoimmune reactivity, or they may directly interfere with phospholipid metabolism in schizophrenia patients. They may also have prothrombogenic effects. Inflammatory markers are also elevated during acute psychosis, which may lead to an increased risk of pathological blood coagulation (7). Hyperhomocysteinemia, which is also a risk factor for VTE, can occur in patients with mental disorders who also smoke, have poor dietary habits, and consume excessive amounts of coffee\\n\\nAntipsychotic medications are another risk factor for VTE in patients with a psychotic disease (8). Antipsychotic drugs contribute to the development of a hypercoagulable state through several potential mechanisms, including drug-induced sedation, obesity, hyperprolactinemia, increased platelet aggregation, and elevation of APA (5, 9).'], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: Venous Thromboembolism as an Adverse Effect During Treatment With Olanzapine: A Case Series., context: ['According to a meta-analysis by Barbui et al. (10), exposure to antipsychotic treatment results in a 50% increased risk for VTE. In another meta-analysis, the low-potency antipsychotic agents had the highest odds of VTE (OR 2.91; 95% CI 1.81–4.71), followed by second-generation antipsychotics (OR 2.20; 95% CI 1.22–3.96) and then the traditional neuroleptics (OR 1.72; 95% CI 1.31–2.24) (11). The highest risk of VTE emerges during the first 3 months after initiation of antipsychotic treatment (12). Other studies found the highest risk in the first month after the initiation of an antipsychotic (13, 14). In addition to the time period following drug administration and the antipsychotic drug class used, other risk factors include using higher drug doses, using a combination of several antipsychotic drugs, and parenteral administration of antipsychotic agents (15).\\n\\nThrough a long-term project named ANTRE (ANTipsychotics, ThRombosis, Embolism) involving interdisciplinary cooperation within the University Hospital in Hradec Kralove, we have been aiming to develop a comprehensive approach to the issue of VTE in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Cases of VTE development are carefully recorded. In addition to isolated case reports of VTE development during treatment with different antipsychotic agents, we recorded 10 cases involving the administration of olanzapine.\\n\\nPatients and Methods\\nThe patient group consisted of a total of 10 patients (women n = 3) who were treated with olanzapine. VTE occurrence was monitored prospectively between 2004 and 2013 in a specialized outpatient unit for VTE treatment. The average age of the patients was 46 years, with a range of 17 to 71 years. Three patients had a diagnosis of delusional disorder, two had paranoid schizophrenia, and two had bipolar disorder. The other patient diagnoses were an addiction to multiple narcotic drugs, behavioral disorder related to pregnancy and puerperium, and mental retardation with a behavioral disorder. The duration of psychiatric illness prior to the occurrence of VTE was determined. We also determined the duration and dose of olanzapine utilized prior to VTE and recorded other psychotropic drugs taken concomitantly. Information was collected from patient-reported history, the hospital information system, and reports by attending outpatient psychiatrists. None of the patients had previously suffered from VTE. Patient history was used to determine if there was a family history (FH) of VTE. In the patient group, VTE occurred either during hospitalization or during outpatient care. VTE diagnosis and subsequent treatment were conducted by an internist. If clinical symptoms suggested VTE, then additional examinations were conducted. In all cases, VTE was verified using imaging techniques (duplex ultrasonography, CT angiography) and laboratory methods (D-dimer). Blood tests were used to detect laboratory risk factors.

Frequencies for sex, clinical and laboratory risk factors, smoking, and VTE together with averages for age, weight gain, dose of olanzapine, and length of use were calculated. A paired-sample t-test was used for weight gain.\\n\\nResults\\nVTE manifested clinically as DVT in the lower limbs in nine patients. In one of these patients, PE also developed at the same time. In one patient, VTE manifested clinically as neurological symptoms without symptoms of DVT. These atypical symptoms were due to a paradoxical embolization in the setting of a heart malformation, patent foramen ovale. Clinical or laboratory risk factors for VTE development were present in all the patients. The most frequent clinical risk factors were obesity (n = 7) and smoking (n = 6). The most frequent laboratory risk factors were elevated FVIII level (n = 4) and mild homocysteinemia (HCY) (n = 3). In these patients, mild HCY was always present together with elevated FVIII level. FV Leiden mutation was detected in two patients. Both clinical and laboratory risk factors were present in half (n = 5) of the patients. Positive FH for VTE was found in three patients. In one case, VTE resulted in the death of an affected family member. In six patients, VTE developed within 6 months of olanzapine initiation, and within 3 months in three patients.

It is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. In clinical practice, the spectrum of its use is much wider. Off-label indications include psychotic disorders of various etiologies (toxic and organic), behavioral disorders in patients with dementia, eating disorders, and personality disorders. The relatively high incidence of olanzapine-related VTE may be distorted by the high number of patients treated with this antipsychotic agent.\\n\\nA possible prothrombogenic mechanism of olanzapine at the molecular level is an affinity for 5-HT2A serotonin receptors. Blocking these receptors results in increased platelet aggregation and increased blood coagulability (16). Blockade of α1 adrenergic receptors by olanzapine may cause hypotension and thereby venous stasis in the lower limbs. Another mechanism may be olanzapine-induced production of the antiphospholipid antibodies: lupus anticoagulant (LA) and ACLAs (17). Increasing these APA titers is associated with a prothrombogenic state (18). Olanzapine may also induce a temporary increase in prolactin levels early in the course of treatment. Hyperprolactinemia correlates with increased levels of P-selectin, a platelet activation marker (19).\\n\\nMetabolic symptoms caused by olanzapine represent an indirect mechanism for VTE development. The prothrombogenic metabolic symptoms that often occur during olanzapine treatment include hyperglycemia, hyperleptinemia, dyslipidemia, and weight gain (20). Weight gain is mainly due to the blockade of H1 histamine and 5-HT2C serotonin receptors by olanzapine.\\n\\nObesity [body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30)] is associated with an up to two-fold increase in the risk of VTE development. Obese patients have reduced fibrinolytic activity and capacity. Higher levels of the procoagulation factors FVIII and FIX also occur (21). Central obesity is also accompanied by a procoagulant and hypofibrinolytic state related to inflammation, oxidative stress, dyslipidemia, and ectopic fat deposition (22). In our group, obesity was identified in seven patients. The patients’ body weight increased significantly during olanzapine treatment.'], hint: None\n",

The patient became febrile with neutrophilia (19,157/µL) 4\\xa0days after laparotomy and started to develop clinical signs of a SSI on the 8th day after laparotomy. The patient continued to be febrile and became critically ill despite empirical treatment with ceftriaxone and vancomycin. Raoultella species with extended antimicrobial resistance (AMR) carrying the CTX-M-9 β-lactamase was isolated from the wound discharge. Considering the antimicrobial susceptibility test, ceftriaxone was replaced by ceftazidime.

We describe a 54-year-old woman with history of stage IIIa breast cancer, receiving adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. The chemotherapy was administered through a Poweport® device, the position of which was confirmed with fluoroscopy and function confirmed by flushing the line. Urgent intervention was required as patient was symptomatic and experienced severe right-sided pleuritic chest pain. Radiology also confirmed the extravasation of doxorubicin into the pleural space. Surgical washout of the pleural space and 3 days therapy with i.v. dexrazoxane were carried out to prevent tissue damage and long-term sequelae. Use of dexrazoxane should always be considered following intra-pleural extravasation because of its potential efficacy and reasonable tolerability. However, the best approach to extravasation injury is prevention by systematic implementation of careful, standardized, evidence-based administration techniques.\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\nAnthracycline extravasation is a feared complication of intravenous (i.v.) chemotherapy due to the tissue toxicity of this group of drugs. The reported incidence of the chemotherapy extravasation in the literature varies from 0.01% to 6% [1, 2]. However extravasation into thorax is rare, so far only 10 cases have been reported [1, 3]. A retrospective single centre study showed that improvement in staff training reduced the incidence of this complication by a factor of 10 (0.1–0.001%) over 15 years.\\n\\nVesicant injuries can progress within hours or days, resulting in lasting tissue injury and necrosis. Management is considered an emergency requiring combination of medical and surgical care.\\n\\nManagement of dermal extravasation is well established often requiring reconstructive surgical repair and use of DMSO which is a topical agent [2]. The effects of these agents into pleural or lung tissue are not well defined and there are no standard approaches in the management of accidental intra-pleural extravasation.\\n\\nOur case report describes a 54-year-old female who presented with intra-pleural extravasation of doxorubicin from a malpositioned central venous catheter. Management consisted of urgent surgical intervention and dexrazoxane, which proved to be effective in the long run.\\n\\nCASE REPORT\\nA 54-year-old woman (Mrs XY) was transferred from another facility for management of iatrogenic infusion of doxorubicin into the pleural space through a migrated central venous catheter.\\n\\nHer only medical history was stage IIIA left breast cancer oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive.

      "Predicting with title: Management of anthracycline extravasation into the pleural space., context: ['Adjuvant chemotherapy was recommended following review of histopathology. Prior to the first cycle of chemotherapy, long-term central venous access was established using a Poweport® device. This was inserted through the right subclavian vein using Seldinger technique and no complications were noted at time of procedure. The line position was confirmed with fluoroscopy and function confirmed by flushing the line (see Fig. 1).\\nFigure 1: Position of the line confirmed with fluoroscopy and function confirmed by flushing the line\\n\\n\\n\\nRoutine chest X-ray following procedure demonstrated correct catheter position with no complications.\\n\\nThe first cycle of chemotherapy consisting of 85 mg of i.v. doxorubicin (60 mg/m2) in 50 ml of normal saline and 850 mg of cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2) was given 5 days post-insertion of the port. Prior to the administration of the cytotoxic agents, it was noted that there was no withdrawal of blood from the port on aspiration. Doxorubicin infusion was commenced by nurses as they were able to infuse a flush solution without resistance. Following 6 ml (10 mg) of infused doxorubicin, Mrs XY complained of severe right-sided pleuritic chest pain. Fluoroscopy contrast study demonstrated that central venous catheter had curled unusually, causing perforation of superior vena cava or the azygos vein and migrated into the pleural space (see Fig. 2).\\nFigure 2: Fluoroscopy contrast study showing contrast medium flowed over the surface of the lung in the pleural cavity. The Port-A-Cath tubing tip is now in the pleural cavity.\\n\\n\\n\\nMrs XY was transferred to our institution for urgent surgical washout of the pleural space and i.v. dexrazoxane. She received i.v. dexrazoxane within 6 hours of extravasation. A dose of 1000 mg/m2 was used, administered immediately before the operation followed by 500 mg/m2 daily for 2 days post-operatively.\\n\\nA right thoracoscopic-assisted pleural lavage was performed the same day. The tip of the central catheter was visually identified lodged in the pleural space but there was no frank pneumonitis or direct parenchymal injury to the lung. The catheter was not broken and sutures were found to be intact. It is unclear as to the circumstances that led to the catheter migration to this unusual position.\\n\\nThree chest drains (2\\xa0×\\xa028Fr Mallinckrodt® catheters through port sites and 1\\xa0×\\xa012Fr Arrow® catheter into the axilla) were left in-situ for the purpose of administering 24 hours of ongoing saline infusion (see Fig. 3).\\nFigure 3: Chest drain inserted for continuous irrigation post-procedure\\n\\n\\n\\nPost-operatively Mrs XY recovered well. Drains were sequentially removed by post-operative day 5. Pain was a significant issue in this patient and our Acute Pain Service treated this with fentanyl patient-controlled anaesthesia and a ketamine infusion. She was discharged from hospital on the sixth post-operative day.'], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: Management of anthracycline extravasation into the pleural space., context: ['At cardio-thoracic review 3 weeks post-operatively, she was found to have a small right pleural effusion, which was treated conservatively and there were no other complications (see Fig. 4).\\nFigure 4: Chest X-ray just showing small right pleural effusion without any other abnormalities. Taken at 1 month after the incident.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe completed her adjuvant chemotherapy through a PICC line in 2015. Regular outpatient follow-up assured that Mrs XY is doing well and a repeat chest X-ray, taken 10 months after extravasation, only revealed small pleural effusion (see Fig. 5).\\nFigure 5: Repeat chest X-ray taken 10 months after extravasation again showing right pleural effusion without any other abnormalities\\n\\n\\n\\nDISCUSSION\\nThe anthracyclines (daunorubicin, idarubicin, epirubicin and doxorubicin) are widely utilized in the treatment of solid tumours and haematological malignancies.\\n\\nAnthracycline extravasation is a highly feared local complication of i.v. administration. Compared with other types of injectable anti-tumour drugs, anthracyclines have the potential to cause the most damage or complications because of their mechanism of action on tissue when they extravasate. Anthracyclines bind to the nucleic acids in the DNA of healthy tissues when they leak out of a vein. This process causes cell death and continues to do so as more drug is released into the surrounding tissue. These injuries can become larger, deeper and more painful as the cycle repeats itself [2].\\n\\nCentral venous catheters are frequently used for infusion of vesicant drugs as they provide reliable venous access, high-flow rates and rapid drug dilution. Unfortunately, they may also involve complications, including drug extravasation.\\n\\nImplementation of proper guidelines regarding use of venous catheters for chemotherapy can minimize or prevent complications. Location of the catheter tip should be in high-flow vessels to prevent cytostatic accumulation, which may lead to catheter thrombosis and vessel wall perforation [1]. Prior to anthracycline administration, it is critical to ensure port or peripheral catheter patency and position radiographically. Furthermore, it is necessary to reconfirm the positioning of the catheter when it is not possible to draw blood or infuse a flush solution prior to start of the chemotherapy infusion [4]. In this case, by means of brief aspiration of blood before giving anthracycline, followed by flushing of sodium chloride or glucose solution may have resulted in the detection of the catheter displacement.\\n\\nIndications of extravasation include symptoms of pain or fever. Lab investigations most frequently reveal leucocytosis. Radiology, most preferably CT scan, should be used for diagnosis of extravasation [1, 3, 4].'], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: Management of anthracycline extravasation into the pleural space., context: ['Immediate discontinuation of the infusion and aspiration of as much solution as possible through the central venous catheter must be done in all cases of extravasation [3]. Identification of local extravasation and surgical intervention wherever feasible to remove as much of the agent as possible [3] and at the same time administering dexrazoxane must be instituted to prevent major complications [4].\\n\\nBefore the approval of dexrazoxane for anthracycline extravasation, topical DMSO, ice application and/or use of steroids were recommended as a plausible approach. In the review of intrathoracic extravasation of chemotherapeutic agents from implanted ports by Bozkurt et al., anthracycline extravasation was reported in two cases and one case was in combination with five fluorouracil. Most of the patients developed pleural effusion like our Mrs. XY or pericardial effusion. Management consisted of aspiration of the residual drug as much as possible before removing the catheter, flushing of the cavities with normal saline and/or systemic administration of steroids. Surprisingly, all of them had a favourable outcome [3].\\n\\nIn 2007, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved dexrazoxane for injection for the treatment of extravasation resulting from i.v. anthracycline chemotherapy [5]. Dexrazoxane acts as a reversible topoisomerase II inhibitor and ring chelating agent, thereby reducing the formation of anthracycline–iron complexes, which are toxic to surrounding tissue [2, 4].\\n\\nIn Europe, two prospective clinical studies of the efficacy of dexrazoxane (TT01 and TT02) in preventing the potentially devastating effects of biopsy-proven anthracycline extravasation in the skin demonstrated that dexrazoxane treatment is highly effective both on a short and long-term basis. Epirubicin was involved in 56% of the cases, 41% were treated with doxorubicin while two received daunorubicin. Four out of 57 had extravasation involving central venous access device and none of them required surgical intervention. The 3 day treatment schedule with dexrazoxane consisting of a daily dose of 1000 mg/m2 on days 1–2 and 500 mg/m2 on day 3 proved effective in preventing surgery-requiring necrosis. Haematological toxicities and transient elevation of liver enzymes associated with dexrazoxane were manageable [2, 6].\\n\\nSince FDA approval of dexrazoxane, subsequent clinical case reports have supported the above-mentioned study findings, and the systemic antidotal treatment has shown value in anthracycline extravasation. Promising results were obtained from a 2007 to 2010 Belgian survey involving 41 patients treated with dexrazoxane from 29 centres. It showed that surgical debridement due to anthracycline extravasation could be avoided in 95.1% of cases (39/41 extravasations) with use of dexrazoxane with manageable toxicities reported in only 8/41 cases [2].'], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: Management of anthracycline extravasation into the pleural space., context: [\"A similar survey in UK was published consisting of 12 cases in which dexrazoxane was administered. These cases did not require surgery and 92% of them continued the chemotherapy as scheduled [2].\\n\\nThere was another identifiable case report by Uges et al. [4] regarding the evolution and management of intra-pleural extravasation through a CVAD using dexrazoxane resulting in a favourable long-term outcome with similar strategy.\\n\\nIn conclusion, prevention is the best approach for managing chemotherapy extravasation. Prior to using venous catheters, their position and function should be adequately checked, with adherence to surgical and oncological procedures. Anthracyclines should be administered as a short infusion only in the presence of healthcare professionals with oncology training.\\n\\nA prospective clinical trial involving the use of dexrazoxane in intra-pleural extravasation is unlikely. Therefore, the use of dexrazoxane in intrathoracic extravasation depends on reports of individual cases and its access, keeping in mind the financial toxicities.\\n\\nUse of dexrazoxane due to its potential benefits and relatively mild side effects along with urgent thoracic intervention should always be considered following intra-pleural extravasation [4].\\n\\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\\n1.

Both patients presented with an acute history of high-grade fever, skin rash, and hematemesis.\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nIn spite of maximal supportive measures and intravenous ribavirin therapy, both patients died within a few days from start of illness. More than 250 health care workers came into variable degrees of contact with the index cases, and none of them developed signs or symptoms suggestive of acquiring the illness. Health care workers from nonendemic regions should be aware of zoonotic hemorrhagic fevers imported via infected cattle and ticks and be able to diagnose and properly manage suspected cases in a timely manner. In addition, proper infection-control measures should be undertaken to prevent nosocomial spread of infection.\\n\\n1. Introduction\\nCrimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is an arthropod-borne viral infection that infects domestic and wild animals and can be transmitted to humans via several routes. The causative agent of CCHF is an RNA virus of the genus Nairovirus belonging to the Bunyaviridae family of viruses (1). Over several decades, serious outbreaks with high case-fatality rates have been reported from different parts of the world, including the Middle East (2-6). CCHF is becoming a global problem, and more cases are expected to be diagnosed as the disease becomes endemic to more areas due to movement of livestock, changes in hunting activities and agricultural practices (7). A real threat exists to health care workers managing patients with CCHF and causing nosocomial outbreaks, which may have high fatality rates (8). Another concern is related to the potential use of the virus as a weapon of bioterrorism, given the limited availability of diagnostic laboratory services with Biosafety Level 4 facilities (9).\\n\\nCCHF is not endemic to UAE; however, two documented limited outbreaks occurred in 1979 and 1994 and were associated with high mortality rates among infected health care workers (10, 11). Here, we report two recent cases of confirmed CCHF.\\n\\n2. Case Presentation\\n2.1. Case 1'], hint: None\n",

The patient was transferred to a single room for isolation with barrier nursing, and strict infection-control measures were adopted to minimize the number of medical staff members in contact with the patient and eliminate exposure to the patient’s body fluids. He underwent endoscopy, which showed severe hemorrhagic gastroduodenitis with active bleeding.

In addition to massive hematemesis and melena, there might be epistaxis, gum bleeding, conjunctival hemorrhage, cerebral hemorrhage, vaginal bleeding, and hematuria. This is the most critical phase of the illness with the highest mortality rates. Patients develop circulatory collapse and severe coagulation disturbance, requiring massive and frequent blood transfusions. Reported case mortality is generally 10 - 40%, though figures as high as 80 - 100% (as in our patients) have been reported, particularly in instances of nosocomial infection. Of note is the difference in mortality between nosocomial cases and community-acquired cases, with significantly higher mortality rates in the former. One explanation could be a lower viral load from a direct tick bite in cases of community-acquired infection.\\t\\n\\nPhase 4\\n\\tConvalescent phase usually begins 15 - 20 days after disease onset in patients who survive the hemorrhagic phase.

Regionally, the disease has been reported in Oman, KSA, Kuwait, Iran, Pakistan, India, and Iraq (13-24).

Drugs commonly associated with the development of SJS/TEN include cotrimoxazole, nevirapine, allopurinol, sulfasalazine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, lamotrigine, and carbamazepine [1].

Rare cases of SSRI-induced epidermal necrolysis, i.e. SJS and TEN, have been described in the literature [7–11]. To our knowledge, no cases of epidermal necrolysis have been described with coadministration of carbamazepine and an SSRI. In the case presented, the patient had been taking carbamazepine for 14\\xa0days after discontinuing fluoxetine. The temporal relationship between the development of SJS after the addition of carbamazepine suggests that carbamazepine was the causative agent. Although the median latency period (interquartile range) for the development of SJS with carbamazepine is 15\\xa0days (12–20) [12], latency periods of 4\\xa0weeks have also been reported [13]. The latency period for SSRI-induced SJS is 1–3\\xa0weeks.

Therefore, carbamazepine and fluoxetine were considered ‘very probable’ and ‘possible’ causes of SJS, respectively, in our patient [14].\\n\\nCarbamazepine-induced SJS has long been thought of as an idiosyncratic, dose independent, unpredictable adverse event specific to an individual [15]; however, current evidence indicates that carbamazepine-induced SJS/TEN is a predictable, specific, delayed hypersensitivity immune reaction involving human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles specific for carbamazepine and other drugs in defined populations [16]. HLA-B*15:02 and HLA-B*31:01 have been associated with carbamazepine-induced SJS in Asian (Han Chinese, Thai, Indian and Malaysian) and Caucasian (and Japanese) populations, respectively [17–19]. Recent evidence suggests this possibility, as shown by the phenytoin and nevirapine-induced SJS/TEN associated with reduced drug clearance due to metaboliser enzyme polymorphisms [20, 21]. However, we were not able to genotype our patient for HLA alleles, therefore we cannot confirm the involvement of the phenotype-specific characteristics of the patient that might have contributed to the development of SJS. Although association with specific HLA genotypes may be necessary, it is not sufficient for the development of SJS/TEN [18]. Other factors such as the individual variation in drug metabolism or clearance, HIV-1 seropositivity, polypharmacy, and competitive drug inhibition may also play an important role in SJS/TEN development with carbamazepine [1, 18, 22, 23].'], hint: None\n",

Given the current understanding of idiosyncratic reactions, a potential increase in carbamazepine plasma concentration due to CYP3A4 inhibition by fluoxetine and norfluoxetine may have reached the threshold for the immune-mediated carbamazepine-induced SJS in our patient, leading to the observed adverse reaction [25, 26]. Increases in plasma carbamazepine or its metabolites increases the likelihood of adverse events, and possibly SJS, as occurs with phenytoin [27, 28]. It is possible that prior administration with fluoxetine may have increased the risk for SJS in our patient. The inhibitory capacity on CYP3A4 substrate clearance can persist up to 3\\xa0weeks post administration of fluoxetine due to the long half-life of norfluoxetine [29]. In our patient, carbamazepine was administered 14\\xa0days after fluoxetine was discontinued; however, we were unable to measure plasma concentrations of carbamazepine to confirm that competitive inhibition of metabolic enzymes by fluoxetine or norfluoxetine was involved in the development of SJS in our patient. Therefore, we cannot conclude that prior administration of fluoxetine may have increased the risk of carbamazepine-induced SJS.\\n\\nAlthough epidermal necrolysis is rare with the use of SSRIs, several case reports have been documented for SJS or TEN with mirtazapine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine and paroxetine [6–10]. Many of the reported cases have occurred in female patients who had received an SSRI for a duration ranging from 3 to 14\\xa0days. In our case, the patient had discontinued fluoxetine for 14\\xa0days when she developed SJS. However, fluoxetine and its major metabolite norfluoxetine have long elimination half-lives of 1–4 days and 7–15\\xa0days, respectively [30]. Although it is possible that fluoxetine or its metabolite norfluoxetine was involved in the development of SJS in our patient, it is more likely that the SJS was caused by carbamazepine and not by fluoxetine.\\n\\nConclusions'], hint: None\n",

However, the occurrence of serious adverse events may cause a decline in QOL. We investigated the relationship between outpatient chemotherapy-induced adverse events and QOL.\\n\\n\\nMETHODS\\nA single-center retrospective descriptive study was conducted in patients who received outpatient chemotherapy at Gifu University Hospital (Gifu, Japan) between September 2017 and December 2018. The utility values of QOL, type and severity of adverse events, type of cancer, chemotherapy regimen, and other patient demographics were analyzed. Adverse events were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. QOL was evaluated using the Japanese version of the EuroQol 5 Dimension 5 Level (EQ-5D-5L). Associations between the EQ-5D-5L utility value and serious adverse events were assessed using adjusted (age and sex) odds ratios obtained with a proportional odds logistic regression model.\\n\\n\\nRESULTS\\nData from 1008 patients who received 4695 chemotherapy cycles were analyzed. According to proportional odds logistic regression, the adverse events that significantly correlated with a decreased EQ-5D-5L utility value were malaise, edema of the limbs, peripheral neuropathy, pruritus, and dry skin. Based on the proportional odds logistic analysis, neither cancer type nor anticancer drugs were significantly correlated with the EQ-5D-5L utility value in patients who received chemotherapy. Pharmaceutical care for peripheral neuropathy significantly improved patients' EQ-5D-5L utility value from 0.747 to 0.776 (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01).\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nAdverse events (i.e., peripheral neuropathy, malaise, and edema of the limbs) are significantly correlated with a decrease in QOL, regardless of the type of cancer or anticancer drugs used. Pharmaceutical care provided by pharmacists in collaboration with physicians may improve QOL.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nThe number of patients who undergo cancer chemotherapy is increasing in parallel with the morbidity and mortality associated with cancer worldwide. Moreover, cancer chemotherapy has transitioned from inpatient to outpatient settings because of advancements in supportive care measures against cancer and changes in the healthcare environment to reduce medical costs [1–4]. Hence, patients are able to continue their personal life and work by undergoing chemotherapy in an outpatient setting. In fact, Ishiura et al. [5] reported that in patients with non-small lung cancer who received vinorelbine, “psychological condition” related to quality of life (QOL) was significantly improved by a transition from inpatient therapy to outpatient chemotherapy.\"], hint: None\n",

This effect may reduce patients’ QOL. Tachi et al. [8] showed that the occurrence of anorexia induced by chemotherapy significantly reduced the QOL of patients with breast cancer. Furthermore, Mark et al. [9] reported that patients with advanced-stage lung cancer who experienced strong negative feelings related to side effects have decreased health-related QOL, and recommended facilitating vigorous management of low-grade adverse events to enhance the health-related QOL of patients. Moreover, Hagiwara et al. [10] showed that grade 1 oral mucositis, grade 1 and 2 fatigue, and grade 2 sensory neuropathy were significantly associated with impaired global health status in the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Version 3.0 in patients receiving first-line chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer.\\n\\nThese findings highlight the importance of reducing adverse events in order to maintain QOL in patients receiving outpatient chemotherapy. Nevertheless, these studies [8–10] investigated only a limited number of cancer types and anticancer agents. Few cross-sectional studies have investigated the association between a decline in QOL and adverse events in patients with a variety of cancer types and taking a variety of anticancer drugs.\\n\\nIn this study, we conducted a retrospective analysis to investigate the impact of current outpatient chemotherapy-related adverse events on QOL.\\n\\nPatients and methods\\nStudy design\\nThis single-center, retrospective, and descriptive study was conducted at Gifu University Hospital, which is affiliated with Gifu University (Gifu, Japan). Patients who underwent cancer chemotherapy at the Gifu University Hospital outpatient cancer chemotherapy clinic between September 2017 and December 2018 were enrolled in the present study.

Briefly, full-time medical staff consisted of two physicians, eight nurses, and four pharmacists.

The Japanese version of the EQ-5D-5L was developed by Shiroiwa et al. [14] to evaluate QOL reflecting Japanese values. The EQ-5D-5L is widely used in clinical studies and health status surveys targeting the general population and uses a comprehensive scale based on preferences to assess cardinal changes in health status [15, 16]. While the values in the Japanese version [14] differ from those in the original, the utility values of QOL in this study were calculated using the Japanese version of the EQ-5D-5L to reflect the values of the Japanese people. We used a hybrid model prepared by mapping discrete choice experiment (DCE) data onto composite time trade-off (cTTO) data [14] to determine the EQ-5D-5L utility value.\\n\\nWe applied to the EuroQoL Group for use of the Japanese version of the questionnaire and obtained permission before use. The Japanese version of the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire was used in face-to-face interviews to estimate the utility values of QOL [14] and was routinely implemented by pharmacists during each patient visit. The utility values were recorded in the hospital’s electronic medical records.\\n\\nThe five dimensions assessed by the EQ-5D-5L are mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each of these is assessed according to five levels of severity: level 1, no problem; level 2, slight problem; level 3, moderate problem; level 4, severe problem; and level 5, unable or extreme problem [13]. A utility value ranging from 0 to 1 was calculated from the EQ-5D-5L, which was defined as the primary outcome of this study. According to the Japanese version of the utility value conversion table, “0” indicates death and “1” indicates full health [17]. The EQ-5D-5L contains only five questions, and patients receiving outpatient chemotherapy can easily answer these questions at each cycle. For these reasons, we used the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire in the present study.\\n\\nAssessment of adverse events\\nAll patients were provided with a daily checklist to confirm their side effects on their first visit to the outpatient chemotherapy clinic. Using the checklist, patients recorded the occurrence of daily adverse events after chemotherapy. From the returned checklists and the results of the interviews, pharmacists, in collaboration with physicians, recorded the severity of adverse events in the electronic medical records.

Pharmaceutical care for adverse events was provided by pharmacists in collaboration with physicians, and the impact of this intervention on the adverse events was assessed during the subsequent visit.\\n\\nEffect of pharmaceutical care on peripheral sensory neuropathy\\nEvidence suggests that moderate peripheral neuropathy (grade ≥ 2) has a strong negative impact on QOL [10]. Therefore, we investigated the changes in QOL induced by anticancer drugs in patients with peripheral neuropathy. These changes were examined at three time points: prior to peripheral sensory neuropathy (control), during the development of peripheral sensory neuropathy (pre-intervention), and after pharmaceutical intervention for peripheral sensory neuropathy (post-intervention).\\n\\nSpecifically, to show that utility values for QOL were reduced by the appearance of peripheral neuropathy, we compared utility values for QOL between “control” and “pre-intervention” time points. In addition, to show that the effect of pharmaceutical intervention for peripheral neuropathy increased utility values for QOL, we compared utility values for QOL between “pre-intervention” and “post-intervention” time points.\\n\\nStatistical analysis\\nPatient demographics were summarized using medians with the 25th and 75th percentiles for parametric variables. Frequencies and percentages are shown for non-parametric variables. As the distribution of the EQ-5D-5L utility value was heavily skewed, we employed proportional odds logistic regression to assess the effect of adverse events on QOL after adjusting for covariates. The proportional odds logistic model, also termed the ordinal logistic model, is a popular model for analyzing ordered outcome variables. This model performs well for skewed continuous outcome variables using the ranks of data. In addition to the moving difference between the current and previous grade of adverse events (changing grade), age and sex were included in the multivariable model. Adjusted associations were analyzed using a regression model with the Huber-White robust sandwich estimator, with patients as a clustering variable. In the secondary analysis, we confirmed the effect of cancer type and anticancer drugs on the EQ-5D-5L utility value using a proportional odds logistic model with adjustment for covariates. An adjusted odds ratio < 1 indicates that QOL is more likely to be worse on average in patients with adverse events, cancer, or those taking anticancer drugs.

He was diagnosed with mitochondrial myopathy by histochemical findings of ragged red fibers (RRF) in the skeletal muscle biopsy and an A3243G point mutation of the mitochondrial tRNALeu gene in a peripheral blood specimen. Further, we performed a literature review on clinical features of adult-onset isolated mitochondrial myopathy with abrupt episodes of respiratory dysfunction as the early and predominant manifestation. Eleven cases have been reported in nine studies (including our study), and five of whom received DNA analysis all carried the A3243G mutation in the tRNALeu gene of the mtDNA (3, 5–11).\\n\\nCase Report\\nA 52-years-old man was transferred to our intensive care unit in July 2016 because of an acute episode of respiratory failure after using anesthetic drugs 8 days earlier. He felt easily fatigued and developed insidiously limb weakness in the previous 6 months. He attributed this to toothache resulting in a poor appetite. However, he was still able to maintain his daily life and keep on working. His family noticed that he lost 7.5 kg of body weight in 6 months and took him to the gastroenterology department of a local hospital. He received a painless gastroscopy and colonoscopy examination using propofol on 19 July 2016. He regained consciousness very slowly for over forty min and was found to have hypoxemia with a blood oxygen saturation degree (SO2) of 86%. After expectant treatment of oxygen inhalation, he recovered to a relative stable condition and drove home. He developed increasing shortness of breath in the following days, which eventually deteriorated into acute respiratory failure. Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis showed a pH of 7.25, and a PaCO2 of 86.25 mmHg. Although the PaO2 level was in a normal range by treatment of oxygen inhalation, the diagnosis of type II respiratory failure was considered because of hypercapnia. A pulmonary function test suggested a moderate restrictive ventilator impairment. No evidence of pneumonia or bronchitis was found through Computed Tomography (CT) scanning. Since he developed recurrent episodes of hypoxemia, hypercapnia and delirium, he received artificial ventilatory assistance on July 26th. Next day, he was transferred to our hospital.'], hint: None\n",

The clinical management of patients with metastatic GISTs is exceptionally challenging due to their poor prognosis. Apatinib is a multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Here, we present the unique case with metastatic GISTs who derived clinical benefit from apatinib following the failure of imatinib and sunitinib. Case presentation: A 57-year-old man was admitted to our hospital diagnosed with metastatic and recurrent GISTs following surgical resection. Fifty-four months after the first-line imatinib treatment, he developed progressive disease and then was treated with cytoreductive surgery combined with imatinib. Disease progression occurred after 7 months. He then received second-line sunitinib and achieved a progression-free survival of 11 months. Apatinib mesylate was then administered. Follow-up imaging revealed a stable disease. Progression-free survival following apatinib therapy was at least 8 months. The only toxicities were hypertension and proteinuria, which were both controllable and well-tolerated. Conclusions: Treatment with apatinib provides an additional option for the treatment of patients with GISTs refractory to imatinib and sunitinib.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nGastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal neoplasms of the gastrointestinal tract (1). Most GISTs harbor activating mutations in either gene encoding KIT or platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α (PDGFRA) (2, 3), which are type III receptor tyrosine kinases (4). After the identification of activating mutations, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are used for GISTs (5), which also significantly improved prognosis of patients with metastatic or recurrent disease (6). Imatinib mesylate is recommended as initial therapy based on drug activity and drug tolerability according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline for advanced GISTs (7). For patients with metastatic or unresectable GISTs after the failure of imatinib, sunitinib is considered (7). However, resistance to sunitinib eventually develops in most patients, after a median of 6–9 months (8). Although regorafenib can significantly improve survival as the third-line treatment, median progression-free survival (PFS) was only 4.8 months. Therefore, the development of efficacious and safe therapies is required for the treatment of metastatic or unresectable GISTs after the failure of imatinib and sunitinib.'], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: Apatinib Treatment in Metastatic Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor., context: ['Apatinib (Hengrui Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) is a multiple TKI and targets vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), PDGFRβ, c-Kit, and c-src (9–11). Apatinib has been proved to be effective and safe in several solid tumors. However, there is no report for apatinib in treating GISTs today. Here, we present a case with metastatic GISTs that was effectively treated by apatinib following the failure of imatinib and sunitinib, demonstrating the potential efficacy of apatinib in the treatment of metastatic or unresectable GISTs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of metastatic GISTs that responds to apatinib.\\n\\nCase Presentation\\nA 57-year-old asymptomatic man was found to have multiple intestinal masses by computed tomography (CT) done as part of his routine medical examination in December 2011. Surgical resection (R0) was performed in December 2011. The resected specimen consisted of a mass measuring 10.0 ×10.0 cm in maximal diameter. Final pathologic diagnosis revealed a high-risk GIST according to the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) criteria (12). The patient was not treated with adjuvant treatment after surgery in the local hospital because he had difficulty paying for adjuvant imatinib therapy. On routine follow-up visit in May 2012, local recurrence and metastasis were confirmed by imaging. He was then referred to West China Hospital in May 2012.\\n\\nBeginning in May 2012, this patient received first-line imatinib orally with a dose of 400 mg/day resulting in a partial response. Disease progression occurred after the continuation of imatinib for 54 months. The patient was then treated with cytoreductive surgery combined with imatinib and showed a PFS of 7 months. New biopsy of an abdominal metastasis yielded a KIT mutation in exon 11 as well as in KIT exon 13 (V654A), confirming the clinical observation of secondary imatinib resistance (13). In May 2017, this patient received second-line sunitinib. After 11 months of treatment, sunitinib was discontinued due to disease progression. The patient refused biopsy for additional mutational analysis for personal reasons.'], hint: None\n",

In the meantime, there was a medical-product-donating project for apatinib that patients could get support since they were enrolled in a clinical trial. After signing informed consent, the patient was treated with apatinib 500 mg daily beginning in April 2018. Abdominal CT scans before apatinib therapy showed the metastatic lesions in the abdomen and pelvic cavity (Figures 1A,B). The drug was well-tolerated, and after 2 months of treatment, the patient had a stable disease (SD) on CT according to RECIST 1.1 (14).

The patient gave written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.\\n\\nDiscussion\\nTo date, the prognosis of patients with progression disease after the failure of imatinib and sunitinib is still poor. In this case, we administered imatinib as the first-line therapy, and PFS was 54 months. Sunitinib was administered as the second-line therapy with a PFS of 11 months. Apatinib was then administered as the third-line therapy. The tumor response was evaluated as an SD. PFS following apatinib therapy was at least 8 months.

      "Predicting with title: Apatinib Treatment in Metastatic Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor., context: ['It is established that most (70–80%) GISTs harbor KIT mutations, resulting in ligand-independent kinase activation (4, 16). Twenty to twenty-five percent of GISTs lack KIT mutations, and of these tumors, a minority (10%) have PDGFRA mutations that are homologous to KIT mutations (prevalence of PDGFRA mutations is about 10%) (4, 16). Still, both KIT and PDGFRA mutations are missing in up to 15% of GISTs, which are called wild-type GISTs. In recent years, an increasing number of TKIs for patients with GISTs after the failure of imatinib and sunitinib have been studied. Regorafenib is the only targeted drug approved by the Federal Drug Administration for advanced GISTs after the failure of imatinib and sunitinib. In the GRID study that compared regorafenib with placebo, the results showed that oral regorafenib significantly improved PFS compared with placebo in patients with metastatic GIST after progression on standard treatments [4.8 months for regorafenib and 0.9 months for placebo; hazard ratio (HR), 0.27; 95% CI, 0.19–0.39] (17). In another Phase III study, nilotinib did not improve either survival (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.64–1.15) or PFS rate as compared to best supportive care in the intent-to-treat analysis. In the post hoc subset analyses, in a well-defined population of true third-line patients, however, nilotinib provided significantly longer median OS (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.48–0.95) (18). The RIGHT trial, a Phase III study, showed that resumption of imatinib in patients with advanced GISTs after the failure of imatinib and sunitinib significantly improved PFS (1.8 vs. 0.9 months; HR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.27–0.78); however, it failed to improve OS (8.2 vs. 7.5 months; HR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.58–1.83) (19).\\n\\nApatinib potently inhibited the kinase activities of VEGFR2, c-kit, and c-src, and decreased the VEGFR2, c-kit, and PDGFRβ stimulated phosphorylation at the cellular level (11). Apatinib has a clinical benefit across various cancers including breast cancer, gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and non-small-cell lung cancer (20). Several subtypes of sarcomas have also been shown to respond to apatinib (21). Here, we report the first case of GISTs responding to apatinib. It seems that apatinib is effective in the treatment of metastatic GISTs resistant to imatinib and sunitinib.'], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: Apatinib Treatment in Metastatic Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor., context: ['Sunitinib and regorafenib, the second- and third-line treatment approved for GISTs, are potently targeting VEGFR in addition to KIT inhibitors. Similarly, apatinib is a potent VEGFR inhibitor apart from the KIT inhibitor. The role of VEGF in GISTs, however, has not been established. Imamura et al. suggested that angiogenesis associated with VEGF might play an important role in in the progression of GISTs (22). Several ex vivo studies of GIST specimens have demonstrated that microvessel density is associated with VEGF expression and closely related to the prognosis of the disease (23, 24). Recently, Verboom et al. proposed that SNPs in the genes encoding for VEGFR2 was associated with PFS in patients with advanced GISTs treated with imatinib (25). Consolino et al. suggested that VEGFR2 and VEGFR3 expression may be related to progression of imatinib-resistant GISTs, and the direct targeting of the receptors may have the potential to decrease tumor growth by the inhibition of angiogenesis (26). Thus, apatinib may have clinical benefits for patients with GISTs refractory to imatinib and sunitinib and need to be further tested in large-scale clinical trials.\\n\\nConclusion\\nThe present case demonstrates that apatinib provides an additional option in the treatment of patients with GISTs refractory to imatinib and sunitinib.

The over-the-counter histamine-2 receptor antagonist famotidine is a putative therapy for COVID-19. We quantitively assessed longitudinal changes in patient reported outcome measures in non-hospitalised patients with COVID-19 who self-administered high-dose famotidine orally.\\n\\n\\n\\nPatients were enrolled consecutively after signing written informed consent. Data on demographics, COVID-19 diagnosis, famotidine use, drug-related side effects, temperature measurements, oxygen saturations and symptom scores were obtained using questionnaires and telephone interviews. Based on a National Institute of Health (NIH)-endorsed Protocol to research Patient Experience of COVID-19, we collected longitudinal severity scores of five symptoms (cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, headaches and anosmia) and general unwellness on a four-point ordinal scale modelled on performance status scoring.

Currently, most research focuses on vaccine development or pharmacological treatment strategies for hospitalised patients with COVID-19.1 However, to reduce global morbidity and mortality, effective treatment strategies for non-hospitalised patients are required.\\n\\nFamotidine may be a candidate medication for this. Famotidine is a histamine-2 receptor antagonist, widely available over the counter at low cost, does not interact with other medications and has been safely used for suppression of gastric acid production over a wide range of oral doses from 20\\u2009mg once daily to 160\\u2009mg four times daily.2 In computer simulations, famotidine was identified as a potential inhibitor of the 3-chymotrypsin-like protease,3 and this and other potential mechanisms of action for famotidine in COVID-19 are an area of current research. In a propensity score matched retrospective cohort study a significantly reduced risk for death or intubation (adjusted HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.88) was identified for patients with COVID-19 who were incidentally taking famotidine before or at the point of hospital admission.4\\n\\n\\nThe incentive for the retrospective cohort study were the unexpected positive results from a group of 10 patients who took famotidine following onset of symptoms for COVID-19.

Information on patient demographics, comorbidities, COVID-19 test results, famotidine use, drug-related side effects, temperature measurements, oxygen saturations and symptom scores were obtained. We collected longitudinal severity scores on five symptoms (cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, headaches and anosmia), based on an NIH endorsed Protocol to research Patient Experience of COVID-19, in addition to general unwellness.5 Symptom scores were retrospectively provided by patients on an ordinal scale: 1=not affected, 2=little affected, 3=affected and 4=severely affected. This four-point scale was based on performance status scoring in patients with cancer who are systemically affected by illness or treatment. We adapted the first four scale points of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) scale6 and provided explanatory text to the patients as part of the symptom questionnaire. We chose only those scale points of the ECOG PS as measures of grades of severity that are relevant to a severity of COVID-19 illness that does not require hospitalisation. The relevant sections of the questionnaire with the introduction to the scale and scoring system were provided to the participants and are included in the online supplementary methods section. Longitudinal symptom scores for the time prior to the COVID-19 illness (baseline, B), the day before starting famotidine (day −1), the day famotidine was started (day 0) and days 1, 2, 7 and 14 after starting famotidine were recorded.

Her renal function deteriorated rapidly. Serum immunoglobulin and complement levels were within normal ranges. An autoantibody examination showed negative for antinuclear antibody and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody. Histologic examination of a renal biopsy specimen revealed that all of the glomeruli had severe crescent formations with no immune deposits. The patient was treated with steroid pulse therapy with cyclophosphamide followed by oral prednisolone. Fifteen days later, she experienced massive recurrent hematochezia. Angiography revealed an active contrast extravasation in a branch of the distal ileal artery. We selectively embolized with a permanent embolic agent. On the 45(th) hospital day, the patient suddenly lost consciousness. Brain computed tomography showed intracerebral hemorrhage. We report a case of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-negative pauci-immune glomerulonephritis with massive intestinal bleeding and cerebral hemorrhage.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nPauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis (GN) is one of the most common causes of rapidly progressive GN (RPGN). Most patients with pauci-immune crescentic GN have glomerular disease as part of an antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)–associated systemic vasculitis, such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, or as a part of renal-limited vasculitis [1]. Because ~75–90% of patients with pauci-immune crescentic GN have circulating ANCA, ANCA is known as a major serologic marker to distinguish pauci-immune crescentic GN from other types of RPGN [2]. Although there is little information about ANCA-negative pauci-immune crescentic GN owing to a relatively small number of patients, several studies have reported fewer systemic vasculitis manifestations in ANCA-negative crescentic GN than ANCA-positive cases. Hemorrhagic complications in pauci-immune crescentic GN are common, but massive gastrointestinal bleeding or cerebral hemorrhage in ANCA-negative pauci-immune crescentic GN has rarely been reported. Herein, we report a rare case of recurrent massive intestinal bleeding that was caused by an uncontrolled vasculitis combined with ANCA-negative pauci-immune crescentic GN.\\n\\nCase report'], hint: None\n",

The serum immunoglobulin levels, including immunoglobulin (Ig)G, IgM, and IgA, and complements, including C3 and C4, were within normal ranges. Immune serologic result was negative for antinuclear antibody and antiglomerular basement membrane antibody. ANCAs also showed negative in indirect immunofluorescence and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.\\n\\nThe renal biopsy specimen showed cellular or fibrocellular crescentic formation in 92% (57/62) of glomeruli (Fig. 1). The tubules revealed focal moderate atrophy and loss with infiltration of mononuclear cells in edematous interstitium. Immunohistochemistry, using three glomeruli, demonstrated no staining for IgG, IgA, IgM, complements (C3, C1q), or fibrinogen. Electron microscopy also showed no dense deposits, with severe effacement of epithelial foot processes.\\n\\nBased on these pathologic findings, she was diagnosed with ANCA-negative pauci-immune crescentic GN.

      "Predicting with title: Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-negative pauci-immune glomerulonephritis with massive intestinal bleeding., context: ['On the 15th hospital day, massive hematochezia occurred, and hemoglobin levels decreased from 9.2\\xa0mg/dL to 6.4\\xa0g/dL within 24 hours (Fig. 2). Initial resuscitation was conducted using a crystalloid solution and packed RBC transfusion. Although emergency gastroscopy and colonoscopy were performed, the bleeding focus was not detected, but a large amount of old blood was observed in the terminal ileum. After 2 days, a colonoscopy was performed again, but abnormal findings associated with bleeding were not detected. Then, a capsule endoscopy was attempted to determine if the bleeding focus was located in the small bowel. However, owing to a slow small bowel transit time, the entire small bowel could not be observed because the capsule did not reach the mid-to-distal ileum. On the 22nd hospital day, recurrent massive hematochezia occurred. Abdominal computed tomography angiography showed active arterial bleeding on the ileal loop, and selective superior mesenteric arteriography revealed an active contrast extravasation in a branch of the distal ileal artery (Fig. 3). We selectively performed embolization with a permanent embolic agent (n-butyl cyanoacrylate; 0.5\\xa0mL tissue adhesive, 1.5\\xa0mL ethionidized oil mixture), and the bleeding stopped.\\n\\nDespite successful embolization, massive hematochezia occurred again after 2 days. Her hemoglobin level was 6.5\\xa0g/dL, and platelet count was 40,000/mm3. The patient received two units of packed RBCs and five units of platelet concentrate. Emergency colonoscopy showed multiple segmental ulcerations on the terminal ileum, which was consistent with ischemic damage due to embolization of the distal ileal artery (Fig. 4). The patient underwent hemodialysis because of intractable metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, and fluid overload. Anemia associated with schistocytes and transfusion-refractory consumptive thrombocytopenia was also present, consistent with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA).

      "Predicting with title: Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-negative pauci-immune glomerulonephritis with massive intestinal bleeding., context: ['Pauci-immune crescentic GN is part of systemic small-vessel vasculitis and usually associated with the presence of ANCAs directed against myeloperoxidase or proteinase 3. Although the pathogenesis of ANCA in vasculitis is not fully understood, ANCA is known to activate neutrophils by different mechanisms, such as direct Fab02 binding to ANCA antigens on leukocyte surfaces or Fc receptor engagement by ANCA immune complexes, leading to apoptosis and necrosis of neutrophil and endothelial cells [3]. However, in ANCA-negative small-vessel vasculitis, neutrophil infiltration of the pathologic lesion is reportedly related with other unidentified autoantibodies or T-cell–dependent mechanisms [4].\\n\\nDespite limited information about ANCA-negative pauci-immune crescentic GN, ANCA-negative patients reportedly show severe renal manifestations, such as nephrotic-range proteinuria, poorer renal outcomes, and less extrarenal involvement such as fever, arthralgia, skin rash, abdominal pain, or mononeuritis multiplex, compared with ANCA-positive patients [5–7]. Similarly, our case also showed nephrotic-range proteinuria of 3.5\\xa0g/d and diffuse cellular crescentic formations in >90% of glomeruli on renal biopsy. Initially, extrarenal manifestations were not observed.\\n\\nOur patient had no evidence of asthma, eosinophilia, or granuloma of the upper respiratory tract. Based on the 2012 International Chapel Hill Consensus criteria, we were able to diagnose MPA and exclude granulomatosis with polyangiitis and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis from the possible systemic small-vessel vasculitis conditions. Hemorrhagic complications in patients with pauci-immune crescentic GN are common [8]. Small-vessel vasculitis can cause local or diffuse pathologic changes in the gastrointestinal tract, including ulcers, bowel wall edema, hemorrhage, paralytic ileus, ischemia, obstruction, and perforation [9–12]. Although necrotizing GN and pulmonary capillaritis are very common in MPA, several cases with gastrointestinal bleeding have been reported. Interestingly, a Japanese case diagnosed with MPA and pauci-immune crescentic GN showed active bleeding of the superior pancreaticoduodenal artery and iliac branch of the superior mesenteric artery [13]. The characteristics of this case were very similar to those of the present case: old age, absence of circulating ANCA, massive active bleeding, and absence of small artery involvement on kidney biopsy. However, our case showed a poor clinical course and a feature of MAHA. Thrombotic microangiopathy is characterized by platelet aggregation in systemic circulation, thrombocytopenia, and mechanical hemolysis. Although coexistence of thrombotic microangiopathy and pauci-immune crescentic GN is rare, pauci-immune crescentic GN could trigger thrombotic microangiopathy through endothelial damage by proinflammatory mediators [14]. Secondary ischemic multiple ulcerations after embolization, thrombocytopenia caused by consumption of platelets due to recurrent bleeding, and MAHA contribute to poor'], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-negative pauci-immune glomerulonephritis with massive intestinal bleeding., context: ['outcomes.\\n\\nInitiation of conventional treatment for pauci-immune crescentic GN with or without ANCA consists of intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy followed by progressive reduction of oral prednisolone (initially 1\\xa0mg/kg/24\\xa0h) and cyclophosphamide, either intravenously at a dose of 0.5–1\\xa0g/m2 or orally at a dose of 2–3\\xa0mg/kg/24\\xa0h [15]. Our patient received conventional treatment according to this schedule, but massive hematochezia occurred 15 days later. In life- or organ-threatening conditions, such as lung hemorrhage or severe ANCA-related renal vasculitis, plasma exchange may be recommended. In cases with gastrointestinal bleeding, widely accepted treatment methods are lacking. Therefore, our patient only received embolization without plasmapheresis or other immunosuppressants, based on previous reports. The causes of intracerebral bleeding in our patient were not clear. Although there was a high possibility of the hemorrhagic complications of systemic vasculitis, brain magnetic resonance angiography was not performed. Various factors that could increase bleeding tendency, such as a uremic condition, low platelet count, or frequent transfusions, may contribute to intracerebral bleeding.\\n\\nIn summary, to the best of our knowledge, there are only a few reports regarding ANCA-negative pauci-immune crescentic GN with massive gastrointestinal bleeding. Therefore, the present case is interesting and informative, reporting recurrent massive intestinal bleeding and fatal intracerebral bleeding as a serious hemorrhagic complication of ANCA-negative pauci-immune GN.\\n\\nConflicts of interest\\nThe authors have no conflicts of interest.\\n\\nFigure 1 Renal biopsy findings.

Most adverse reactions to this group of medications are classified as psychomotor, autonomic or toxic. In the case of suspected hypersensitivity to local anesthetics, skin testing is considered to be a useful tool - patch tests and intradermal tests for delayed hypersensitivity and skin prick tests and intradermal tests for immediate reactions. There is a particular need for such a diagnostic procedure, as patients suspected of hypersensitivity to local anesthetic drugs are frequently admitted.\\n\\n\\nOBJECTIVE\\nTo highlight the problem of hypersensitivity to local anesthetics on the basis of authors' own experience and literature data.\\n\\n\\nMETHODS\\nWe present cases of 5 patients referred to the clinic by their dentists with a suspicion of allergy to local anesthetics, four to lidocaine and 1 to articaine.\\n\\n\\nRESULTS\\nIntradermal tests were positive in 1 out of 5 subjects, with a concomitant episode of urticaria. In 1 patient we obtained a doubtful result of intradermal tests. Skin prick tests and patch tests were negative in all cases. In 2 cases we performed an incremental challenge test also with a negative result.\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nIt has to be emphasized that, although rare, consequences of true allergy to local anesthetics can be serious considering a patient's future management and therapy. That is why this diagnosis may be crucial.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nLidocaine represents the most common local anesthetic (LA) agent employed in local or regional anesthesia, included as a constituent of EMLA, a eutectic mixture of lidocaine and prilocaine [1, 2]. Although most allergic reactions are due to the common metabolic product of the ester local anesthetic, para-amino benzoic acid, cross-reactivity among esters is common. Ingredients in LA solutions such as antioxidants or preservatives including metabisulphite or parabens may also elicit allergic or adverse reactions. Articaine solutions should be avoided in those allergic or hypersensitive to sulphite, due to the content of sodium metabisulphite as the vasoconstrictor's antioxidant in it. The LA (without preservatives or adrenaline) may be skin tested.\\n\\nTrue allergy to LA is rare, with a genuine immunological reaction representing only 1% of all adverse reactions to these medications [3–5]. In traditional classifications, adverse reactions to LA have been categorized as allergic, toxic and autonomic [3]. Most of the patients undergoing dental procedures exhibit some degree of autonomic response to an injection, such as sweating, tachycardia or even syncope. However, it is usually mild and transient. Toxic reactions are mostly observed as a consequence of a rapid intra-vascular injection of LA or may be associated with an overdose in patients defectively metabolizing the drug.\"], hint: None\n",

What is more, the term “allergy” to LA is often easily accepted by the patient, who then expects it to be proven by available diagnostics. Many times an adverse reaction took place several years prior to the testing with reliable documentation of the event lacking.\\n\\nAim\\nThe aim of the paper is to highlight the problem of hypersensitivity to local anesthetics on the basis of authors’ own experience and literature data.\\n\\nMaterial and methods\\nWe present 5 cases of patients (3 women and 2 men aged 19–50), admitted to the Department of Dermatology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences. All patients were referred to our Department by their dentists with a suspicion of allergy to LA. In the case of 4 patients, lidocaine was suspected as a culprit drug; in 1 case, articaine was suspected.\\n\\nThree patients experienced an adverse reaction 2–2.5 months prior to diagnosis. In 2 subjects, the time interval between the reaction and diagnosis was much longer, being 17 and 25 years. Three patients had symptoms of an adverse reaction during a dental procedure involving the use of LA; 2 patients experienced an adverse reaction during tonsillectomy. In regards of the type of the adverse event, 2 patients experienced syncope, 1 had an episode of disseminated urticarial wheals and another had cardiac palpitations and anxiety. One female patient experienced an adverse reaction over 20 years earlier, for which there was no reliable documentation except the suggestion of a “severe immediate allergic reaction” by her family doctor.\\n\\nA thorough case history was recorded with the use of the Polish version of the European Network of Drug Allergy (ENDA) questionnaire [6, 7]. Skin prick tests (SPT) with chosen LA, followed by intradermal tests (IDT) were performed using 1: 10 000, 1: 1000 and 1: 100 dilutions for lidocaine and 1: 10 dilution for mepivacaine and articaine. We used LA preparations with no additional vasoconstrictors (e.g. epinephrine). All the procedures (STP followed by IDT if negative, dilution of examined medications) were performed thoroughly with the maximal safety considerations respected, especially in regards of possible immediate hypersensitivity reactions.\\n\\nHistamine and normal saline served as a positive and negative control, respectively. The SPT was considered positive when the mean diameter of an allergen wheal was equal or slightly larger than the mean diameter of the histamine wheal (+++) and when the mean diameter of an allergen wheal was at least twice as big as the mean diameter of the histamine wheal (++++) or in any case of response with pseudopodia (++++). The IDT was regarded positive if the diameter of an allergen wheal was at least 5 mm. Both for SPT and IDT readings were performed after 15–20 min, 60 min and after 24 h.'], hint: None\n",

While obtaining a history, it often eventuates that the patient might have experienced rather a syncopal episode associated with an injection or cardiac palpitations due to action of epinephrine in administered solution or released endogenously. According to Wildsmith [10], among 25 patients initially diagnosed as being allergic to LA during dental treatment, 6 were diagnosed as suffering from phobia, panic or anxiety, 1 patient received an intravascular injection (adrenaline content of the cartridge), 1 patient appeared to be allergic to metabisulphite and latex allergy accounted for problems with 3 patients.'], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: Allergy to lidocaine injections: comparison of patient history with skin testing in five patients., context: ['Allergic responses to LA are rare. In the majority of cases, hypersensitivity to this group of drugs may be excluded. It is suggested that the amide class of LA (lidocaine, mepivacaine, bupivacaine, articaine, prilocaine) is significantly less allergic than the ester type (benzocaine, procaine, tetracaine), There is also limited cross-reactivity between amide LA drugs [11]. However, according to data published by Zanni et al. [12], good agreement may be observed between clinical sensitization, PT and lymphocyte transformation test, indicating that there is a high degree of cross-reactivity between lidocaine and mepivacaine, also on the clonal level.\\n\\nAmong allergic reactions to LA, type IV hypersensitivity responses have been described predominantly to ester LA and clinically are represented by either contact dermatitis or rashes (macular or maculopapular) [13]. Torres et al. [14] also described the first case of fixed drug eruption induced by mepivacaine. This report was followed by others [15, 16]. Contact allergy to amide anesthetics is rare and, according to Klein and Gall [17] in 1991, only 18 cases had been reported since these medications began to be used in the 1940s. Most of the delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions take place after a topical application of the drug [18]. There have been also reports of cases presenting as contact dermatitis due to subcutaneous administration of LA, which have been confirmed by patch testing. Bircher et al. [13] described a case of a delayed-type reaction to LA with subsequent positive PT to lidocaine, mepivacaine and prilocaine but negative to articaine. Kanerva et al. [19] described a case of a 48-year-old patient, who developed contact dermatitis after an infiltration with mepivacaine and lidocaine and they concluded that diagnostic approach of a patient suspected of delayed-type hypersensitivity to LA should include not only PT, but also IDT.\\n\\nImmediate IgE-mediated allergic responses, particularly to amide type LA, are uncommon. According to some authors, in more than 30 years of their practice, there has never been verified an immediate allergic reaction to LA using available diagnostic technology [10]. However, there are case reports of adverse reactions to LA, suggesting type I hypersensitivity, where signs and symptoms tend to occur within minutes of drug injection and include urticaria, episodes of angioneurotic edema, wheezing, sneezing, pruritus or even anaphylactic shock [3, 10].'], hint: None\n",

Unfortunately, if such extravasation occurs into the pleural space, limited data is available to guide appropriate management. We present the first report in the literature of video-assisted thoracoscopy combined with a topoisomerase II inhibitor and iron chelator, dexrazoxane, in the successful management of this complication.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nA 50‐year‐old woman with breast cancer required urgent thoracoscopy, following the iatrogenic infusion of doxorubicin into her pleural space through a mal‐positioned central venous catheter.\\n\\nHer only relevant medical history was high‐risk invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast, for which a bilateral mastectomy and left axillary lymph node clearance had already been performed.\\n\\nCase report\\nPrior to commencing the first cycle of adjuvant chemotherapy, long‐term central venous access was gained through the insertion of the Powerport with Groshong Catheter (BARD, Inc., Murray Hill, NJ, USA) through the right subclavian vein. No complications were noted at the time of the procedure. The position of the line was confirmed with fluoroscopy and routine chest X‐ray (Fig 1).\\n\\nFigure 1 Chest X ray confirming the position of the central venous catheter.\\n\\nThe first cycle of chemotherapy consisted of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. Following the infusion of doxorubicin, the patient soon complained of severe right side pleuritic chest pain. A fluoroscopy contrast study showed that the central venous catheter was draining into the pleural space (Fig 2).\\n\\nFigure 2 Fluoroscopy contrast study showing the tip of the catheter (arrow) draining into the pleural space and thoracoscopy image confirming the tip of the catheter lodged in the pleural space.\\n\\nA right thoracoscopic‐assisted pleural lavage was performed the same day. This visually confirmed that the tip of the central catheter was lodged in the pleural space but there was no frank pneumonitis or direct parenchymal injury to the lung (Fig 2). Ten liters of warmed normal saline were used to wash out the pleural space. Three chest drains were left for the purpose of administering 24\\u2009hours of saline irrigation.\\n\\nPeri‐procedural intravenous infusion of an initial dose of 1000\\u2009mg/m2 dexrazoxane was administered immediately before the operation, followed by 500\\u2009mg/m2 daily for two\\u2009days postoperatively.\\n\\nShe recovered well from the incident.\\n\\nDiscussion\\nAnthracyclines, for example, daunorubicin, idarubicin, epirubicin, and doxorubicin, are widely used cytotoxic drugs in the treatment of hematological malignancies and solid tumors. These agents are especially prone to cause severe tissue damage on extravasation compared with other types of injectable antitumor drugs.1'], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: Video-assisted thoracoscopy in the management of intrapleural extravasation of cytotoxic chemotherapy., context: ['Anthracyclines have the potential to cause the most damage or complications because they bind to the DNA of healthy tissue when they leak out of a vein. This process causes cell death and continues to do so as more of the drug is released into the surrounding tissue, causing pain, as in the described case.2\\n\\n\\nThe topoisomerase II inhibitor and iron chelator, dexrazoxane, has been proven to prevent the potentially devastating effects of anthracycline extravasation. It is highly effective with minimal side effects and is well tolerated by patients.3 Dexrazoxane is approved by the Food and Drug Administration, but not the Therapeutic Goods Administration, and has limited availability in Australia.\\n\\nExtravasation is caused by mal‐positioning of central venous catheters, which can be classified as primary occurring at the time of placement, or secondary occurring sometime after placement. The causes of secondary mal‐positioning are poorly understood, as in our case, where initial investigation seemed to confirm correct positioning (Fig 1). Fracture and distal embolization of the catheter as part of the “pinch‐off” syndrome is far more common.4\\n\\n\\nBecause of the small number of thoracic extravasation injuries, there is no consensus on the most appropriate treatment, which is extrapolated from experience with peripheral access.5 Surgical procedures with the objective of draining the remaining solution after discontinuation of the infusion, along with dexrazoxane, must be considered as soon as possible to prevent major complications.\\n\\nSurgical options, such as percutaneous drainage, thoracoscopy, and open thoracotomy can be used. Unfortunately, the percutaneous option can cause subsequent complications because of the visual limitations of insertion, as in a case reported by Uges et al. where the percutaneous drainage was complicated by empyema.6\\n\\n\\nIn our case, we decided to use video‐assisted thoracoscopy to confirm the catheter position and to further assess the local tissue damage from doxorubicin. It also guided an accurate lavage of the cavity, the placement of the catheters that were used posteriorly for continuous irrigation, and helped to safely remove the mal‐positioned catheter (Fig 2).\\n\\nIn conclusion, combined early medical and surgical management of pleural extravasation of cytotoxic drugs, such as anthracyclines, is essential. Video‐assisted thoracoscopy can confirm tissue damage and aid drainage, lavage, and subsequent irrigation of the cavity. We recommend its use in combination with dexrazoxane, which is well tolerated and prevents short and long term toxicity.\\n\\nDisclosure\\nNo authors report any conflict of interest.'], hint: None\n",

From June 2004 to January 2005, the patient received six cycles of conventional treatment combined with intravenous paclitaxel (Taxol®) and cisplatin. The patient developed abdominal distension and experienced a gradual deterioration in health during 2007, with admission to The First Affiliated Hospital in May 2007. The patient presented with severe abdominal distension and breathing difficulty on May 15 and appeared to be in critical condition. Ultrasound examination revealed massive ascites and left-side pleural effusion. Thoracentesis and abdominocentesis were performed, and 300 mg carboplatin was administered intraperitoneally on May 19, followed by a second abdominocentesis on May 21. However, these treatments did not alleviate the symptoms, and 200 mg bevacizumab was administered by intravenous infusion on May 27. The condition of the patient gradually improved and 400 mg bevacizumab was administered by intravenous infusion every two weeks from June 9. From December, the dosage of bevacizumab was reduced to 200 mg every two weeks. In addition, 300 mg carboplatin was administered intraperitoneally on November 4 and intraperitoneal carboplatin chemotherapy was repeated thereafter. The patient exhibited disease-free survival until July 2009, at which time disease progression was observed and the cancer recurred in August 2009.

Therefore, bevacizumab is an effective therapy for late-stage relapse and refractory ovarian cancer.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nOvarian epithelial carcinoma is one of the most common gynecological cancers (1). Once clinical symptoms are apparent, patients have developed mid- to late-stage ovarian cancer, at which point aggressive treatments may yield more favorable results than conservative ones. Surgery remains the primary treatment for stage III ovarian cancer and allows removal of gross disease. Following surgery, intravenous (IV) or intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy extends the survival time of patients and is associated with superior results for recurrent ovarian cancer relative to other treatment modes. In addition to IV and IP chemotherapy, other treatment regimens, including oral chemotherapy, hormones and gonadotrophin-releasing hormone antagonists, exert certain positive effects (2). More recently, biologic therapy for ovarian cancer has become an area of focus and may be attempted in clinical treatment (3).\"], hint: None\n",

Paclitaxel/carboplatin chemotherapy is more suitable for patients with a poor performance status than for patients with a good performance status. However, the outcome of chemotherapy for elderly patients with advanced disease and a poor performance status has not been reported. Chemotherapy is also contraindicated for patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance statuses of 3 or 4.\\n\\nThe combination of bevacizumab with carboplatin/paclitaxel is associated with significantly longer disease-free survival than carboplatin/paclitaxel alone. However, no significant difference has been observed between bevacizumab plus carboplatin/paclitaxel and carboplatin/paclitaxel in terms of overall survival rate (5). Thus, bevacizumab does not appear to confer any survival advantage, and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network panel does not recommend its use. Bevacizumab may be used as a maintenance drug subsequent to chemotherapy; however, clinical studies have indicated that it results in numerous many side effects. Therefore, clinicians should consider the advantages and disadvantages of bevacizumab prior to prescribing the drug to patients.\\n\\nCase report\\nAn 82-year-old female, who presented with abdominal distension, abdominal pain, a slight sense of fullness subsequent to eating and increased urination frequency every day for two months was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in May 2004.

      "Predicting with title: Epithelial ovarian cancer: A case report., context: ['Bevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin improves the progression-free survival of patients with ovarian cancer; however, it does not increase their overall survival time. Furthermore, the use of the drug in maintenance therapy subsequent to chemotherapy does not appear to increase overall survival (5). Other studies have indicated that bevacizumab does not increase overall survival in any cancer type, despite its ability to prolong progression-free survival (10–12). Thus, it was concluded that no overall survival benefit may be derived from bevacizumab. However, chemotherapy is contraindicated for patients with massive ascites, massive pleural effusions, breathing difficulties and poor performance status. Continuing chemotherapy in such cases may aggravate the patient’s condition and possibly lead to death. In the present case study, the patient’s ascites and pleural effusion disappeared following administration of bevacizumab, and a significant improvement in performance status was observed. IP chemotherapy combined with bevacizumab also led to extended disease-free survival. Thus, the role of bevacizumab in prolonging survival in patients with ovarian cancer warrants further study. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure of the patient rose continually until her death; such increases in arterial pressure may be associated with the use of bevacizumab.\\n\\nChemotherapy regimens for platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer include monotherapy with agents such as cisplatin and carboplatin, as well as combination therapies, including paclitaxel plus carboplatin, carboplatin plus gemcitabine and cisplatin plus gemcitabine (13–16).

Adjunct intracoronary thrombolysis (ICT) has been described in cases with failure of thrombus aspiration (TA),7–9 large ectatic vessels,5,10 and to facilitate PCI in technically difficult lesions.11 We present a series of four patients with different indications for the use of ICT in the setting of STEMI.\\n\\nTimeline\\n \\tPatient 1\\tPatient 2\\tPatient 3\\tPatient 4\\t\\nSymptom onset\\t−4 h\\t−4 h\\t−2\\t−2 days\\t\\nTriage\\t0 h\\t0 h\\t0 h\\t0 h\\t\\nOn table\\t59 min\\t48 min\\t31 min\\t47 min\\t\\nThrombus aspiration\\tN/A\\t94 min\\t66 min\\t77 min\\t\\nThrombolysis in myocardial infarction grade three flow\\t167 min\\t139 min\\t68 min\\t75 min\\t\\nIntracoronary thrombolysis\\t130 min\\t161 min\\t106 min\\t97 min'], hint: None\n",

The patient remained without an evidence of CLL until his death from recurrent glioblastoma. Further study of temozolomide for the treatment of CLL is indicated.\\n\\nWe report a patient with glioblastoma multiforme who was treated with surgery followed by radiation therapy and temozolomide. He incidentally had Binet stage A chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) at diagnosis, which responded completely to this treatment. Chlorambucil has been the standard alkylating agent used for CLL for many years. However, the complete and overall response rates for chlorambucil monotherapy range from only 0–7% and 31–72%, respectively 1, 2. Chemo‐immunotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab yields much higher rates of complete responses that are sometimes durable, but not thought to be curative and is associated with significant toxicity, especially in the elderly 3. The observation of a complete response of CLL to temozolomide is therefore interesting.\\n\\nThe patient was a previously healthy 60‐year‐old man who presented with confusion, headache, and right‐sided visual disturbance and was found to have a mass in the left cerebral hemisphere that was completely resected and found to be glioblastoma.

Peripheral blood flow cytometry showed no evidence of CLL. The splenic lesion did not change on CT. A postmortem examination performed 7 months after the conclusion of temozolomide treatment showed no evidence of CLL in the blood, bone marrow, spleen, or any other tissue. The splenic lesion was shown to be a histiocytic sarcoma, clonally unrelated to the CLL.\\n\\nThis patient also received corticosteroids for cerebral edema and external beam radiotherapy, both of which may contribute to lymphocytotoxicity. However, both have been used as adjunctive treatments for CLL and complete responses are not seen from these treatments. The complete response seen in this case is much more likely to be due to temozolomide.\\n\\nTemozolomide has several properties, suggesting it may be useful in the treatment of CLL. It is generally well tolerated with a dose limiting toxicity of myelosuppression, occurring in 7% of patients treated with on the Stupp trial 4. Elderly patients are reported to tolerate temozolomide well 5. Lymphopenia with attendant risks for Pneumocystis Jiroveci pneumonia and herpes zoster, however, is temozolomide's most characteristic toxicity 6. Temozolomide's effect on depletion of T cells and NK cells has been extensively documented. It also has also been shown to deplete B cells with a significant decrease in both the percentage and absolute number of CD19 + B lymphocytes 7. Furthermore, temozolomide has been employed as a lympho‐depleting agent to enhance vaccine‐driven immune responses in murine models of melanoma and in pilot clinical trials in glioblastoma patients 8.\\n\\nTemozolomide is indicated for the treatment of glioblastoma and anaplastic astrocytoma in adults. It also finds unlabeled use in mycosis fungoides, Ewings sarcoma, metastatic melanoma, soft tissue sarcoma, neuroendocrine tumors, and primary CNS lymphoma. Neither a PubMed search nor discussion with the drug manufacturer revealed reports for the treatment of CLL with temozolomide. This serendipitously observed complete response, coupled with its lymphocytotoxic activity, ease of oral administration and generally well‐tolerated safety profile even in the elderly provide rationale for the formal study of temozolomide's activity in CLL.\\n\\nAuthorship\\nAR: first author who performed literature review and wrote the manuscript.

      "Predicting with title: The tacrolimus metabolism rate influences renal function after kidney transplantation., context: [\"The effective calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) tacrolimus (Tac) is an integral part of the standard immunosuppressive regimen after renal transplantation (RTx). However, as a potent CNI it has nephrotoxic potential leading to impaired renal function in some cases. Therefore, it is of high clinical impact to identify factors which can predict who is endangered to develop CNI toxicity. We hypothesized that the Tac metabolism rate expressed as the blood concentration normalized by the dose (C/D ratio) is such a simple predictor. Therefore, we analyzed the impact of the C/D ratio on kidney function after RTx. Renal function was analyzed 1, 2, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after RTx in 248 patients with an immunosuppressive regimen including basiliximab, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and prednisolone. According to keep the approach simple, patients were split into three C/D groups: fast, intermediate and slow metabolizers. Notably, compared with slow metabolizers fast metabolizers of Tac showed significantly lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) values at all the time points analyzed. Moreover, fast metabolizers underwent more indication renal biopsies (p\\u200a=\\u200a0.006) which revealed a higher incidence of CNI nephrotoxicity (p\\u200a=\\u200a0.015) and BK nephropathy (p\\u200a=\\u200a0.024) in this group. We herein identified the C/D ratio as an easy calculable risk factor for the development of CNI nephrotoxicity and BK nephropathy after RTx. We propose that the simple C/D ratio should be taken into account early in patient's risk management strategies.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nThe calcineurin-inhibitor (CNI) tacrolimus (Tac) is one of the most effective immunosuppressive drugs used for renal transplantation (RTx). In combination with mycophenolate mofetil, prednisolone and daclizumab, Tac regimen showed a superior graft function, better prevention of acute rejection and superior graft survival after 12 months compared to cyclosporine A and sirolimus [1].\\n\\nUnfortunately, Tac has a narrow therapeutic window. It can lead to acute as well as to chronic nephrotoxicity. Acute Tac nephrotoxicity due to high Tac levels typically presents early after RTx as e.g. isometric vacuolizations of tubular cells. In fact, even as early as one month after RTx, glomerulosclerosis in renal allografts can be associated to CNI nephrotoxicity. Typical chronic CNI-related allograft changes include tubule-interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy (IF/TA), tubular microcalcifications, glomerulosclerosis and artheriolar hyalinosis. Acute tubular damage can be reversed within the first three months after RTx, however, chronic lesions observed after the third month are usually progressive ones [2]–[4].\"], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: The tacrolimus metabolism rate influences renal function after kidney transplantation., context: ['Although there seems to be a strong association between higher CNI trough levels and nephrotoxicity [5], nephrotoxic effects of Tac can occur even at prescribed low-level regimens (4–6 ng/mL) [6]. In that context it is important that Tac metabolism depends on individual factors - clinical and genetic ones. Clinical variables like haematocrit, serum albumin, age, gender, body mass index (BMI) or absorption have been proposed to be significant influencing variables [7], [8]. However, some are still a matter of debate. The most relevant genes encode the cytochrome-P450 enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 leading to significant differences in Tac pharmacodynamics [9]. However, genetic profiling of patients is still far from been a routine test and the dosage needed to reach target Tac level varies in patients with known CYP3A polymorphisms over the time [10]. Of higher clinical relevance is that physicians have to take interactions influencing Tac metabolism into account when prescribing new drugs. In the transplant setting interactions with other immunosuppressive drugs, such as corticosteroids, sirolimus and everolimus are considered in daily routine. Nevertheless, the clinical relevance of these interactions remains widely unclear [11]. Yet another unanswered question of interest is, if the presence of CYP3A5 in the apical tubular plasma membrane observed in kidneys with CNI nephrotoxicity is causally relevant or not [12], [13].\\n\\nTherefore, factors which can predict patients’ risk to develop Tac side effects or promote clinically reasonable handling of Tac are of high interest to transplant surgeons and nephrologists.\\n\\nWe hypothesize that the Tac metabolism rate expressed as the simple blood concentration normalized by the dose (C/D ratio) is such a predictor.\\n\\nMaterials and Methods\\nStudy population and clinical data\\nWe analyzed data from 311 patients who underwent RTx between January 2007 and March 2012. Immunosuppressive regimen consisted of Tac (Prograf), mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept) and prednisolone (Soludecortin H/Decortin H). An induction therapy with basiliximab (Simulect) was given at day 0 and 4. Tac was started at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg bid with a target trough level of 7–12 ng/mL during the first month, 6–10 ng/mL from month 2 to 3 and 3–8 ng/mL for the following time. 1 g mycophenolate mofetil bid was administered and adapted in case of adverse events like leukopenia, diarrhea and infections. Prednisolone was started with 250 mg intravenous (i.v.) before and directly after transplantation, following 3 days of 100 mg i.v. per day. Then prednisolone was reduced by 20 mg per day. 20 mg/day was kept until the end of the first month. Afterwards, it was tapered. 10 mg qd was continued for the first 3 months and tapered to a maintenance dosage of 5 mg qd after 6 months.'], hint: None\n",

Sofosbuvir/Ledipasvir (Sof/Led) is a new once daily direct acting antiviral combination pill that was approved in October 2014 for use in patients with HCV genotype 1 infection. Coadministration of Sof/Led is studied only with rosuvastatin which shows significantly increased level of drug and is associated with increased risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis. There is no mention of such HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor interaction as a class, as pravastatin did not have any clinically significant interaction with Sof/Led. Other myotoxic drugs, including colchicine are not studied. We present a case of a serious drug interaction between Sof/Led and atorvastatin, in the background of CKD and colchicine use.\\n\\n1. Case Report\\nWe present a case of 66-year-old African American female with medical history of compensated liver cirrhosis related to chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1a infection, stage III Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) related to hypertensive nephropathy, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and gout, who was recommended to start Sofosbuvir/Ledipasvir (Sof/Led) as 400/90\\u2009mg tablet along with renal dosed ribavirin 200\\u2009mg twice daily for 12 weeks for her HCV infection. The regimen was selected based on the presence of biopsy proven early cirrhosis and HCV infection, which was treated in the past with pegylated interferon, telaprevir, and ribavirin (she relapsed after early termination of this regimen because of intolerable side effects). Two weeks prior to the initiation of current treatment attempt with Sof/Led and ribavirin, baseline labs were unremarkable, as indicated in Table 1. Her daily home medications colchicine 0.6\\u2009mg, atorvastatin 80\\u2009mg, allopurinol, clonidine, lisinopril, labetalol, and aspirin were continued.

Blood tests at that time (as indicated in Figure 1, day 23), showed undetectable HCV viral load, with new elevations of liver enzymes and she was advised to increase oral hydration for symptomatic relief. One week later (day 30), she presented to emergency room with complaints of profound weakness and myalgia along with ongoing nausea and abdominal pain. On physical examination, she appeared slightly dry, with slight periumbilical tenderness and without ascites. She demonstrated diffuse muscle weakness and muscle tenderness in all extremities. No focal neurologic deficit was identified. The admission labs (as noted in Table 1 and Figure 1, day 30) were noticeable for elevated liver enzymes, creatinine, and creatine phosphokinase (CPK). Urinalysis showed large amount of blood, without RBCs. Clinical diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis was made. Her atorvastatin was stopped and she was aggressively fluid resuscitated. CPK levels subsequently trended down and renal function returned to baseline. The workup for myalgia was unremarkable, with normal aldolase, C3 and C4 complement levels, TSH, and serum protein electrophoresis. Neurology evaluation was done, and EMG was done to evaluate for profound muscular weakness. EMG showed diffuse muscle irritability with no evidence of polyneuropathy, suggesting this patient had an inflammatory myopathy.\\n\\nRhabdomyolysis was considered likely from an interaction between Sof/Led, atorvastatin, and colchicine in the background of abnormal renal function. The rise of AST/ALT was considered to be from her rhabdomyolysis (nonhepatic). Colchicine was also stopped and she was continued on Sof/Led and low dose ribavirin with daily monitoring of her labs. By the time of discharge, her rhabdomyolysis resolved, with return of baseline GFR of 43\\u2009mL/min/1.73\\u2009m2. Although her myalgia improved, she was discharged home with persistent muscle weakness, which subsequently improved over the next 4 weeks with physical rehabilitation. She successfully completed 12-week course of HCV therapy and did not have any recurrent symptoms or findings of rhabdomyolysis as she was kept off atorvastatin and colchicine. Her muscle weakness had resolved by the time she finished her therapy. Her follow-up labs showed SVR12 (Table 1); thus, her HCV infection was considered cured and her renal function and other laboratory testing returned to baseline.\\n\\n2. Discussion\\nOn October 10, 2014, the FDA approved the fixed-dose combination pill Sof/Led (Harvoni, Gilead Sciences) for the treatment of chronic HCV genotype 1 infection [1]. Sof is a nucleotide NS5B polymerase inhibitor and Led is an NS5A inhibitor for HCV [2]. The common side effects of Sof/Led are fatigue and headache. Interestingly, benign, asymptomatic elevation of CPK has been reported in patients taking Sof/ribavirin or interferon/ribavirin [3].'], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: An Unexpected Interaction between Sofosbuvir/Ledipasvir and Atorvastatin and Colchicine Causing Rhabdomyolysis in a Patient with Impaired Renal Function., context: [\"There have been no case reports of Sof/Led interactions with atorvastatin and colchicine in causing rhabdomyolysis. In addition, the Sof/Led label does not mention many drug interactions; however both components are P-gp substrates [4]. Led is an inhibitor of the drug transporters P-gp and Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) and may increase intestinal absorption of coadministered substrates for these transporters [5]. Sof/Led is not recommended to be given with other known P-gp-inducers due to the potential for decrease in efficacy. Led can increase absorption of colchicine by P-gp inhibition and of rosuvastatin via inhibition of BCRP. Coadministration of Sof/Led with rosuvastatin can potentially increase the risk of statin related myopathy and rhabdomyolysis [6]. Sof accumulation in renal failure can also lead to toxicity and the patient should be closely monitored for liver failure if Sof is to be used in these patients. Additionally, colchicine has the independent ability to cause myotoxicity [7]. Sof/Led has not been noted to interact adversely with atorvastatin; however, a theoretical interaction exists via P-gp inhibition by atorvastatin, causing an increased level of led. Atorvastatin can itself increase levels of colchicine due to P-gp inhibition. Using colchicine in combination with a statin has been reported to cause myotoxicity, especially in the setting of CKD [8]. Atorvastatin 80\\u2009mg was used in this patient as it was used for secondary prevention for her coronary artery disease. A lower dose of atorvastatin was not attempted as the patient was symptomatic from her rhabdomyolysis and the patient was not having any active coronary artery disease.\\n\\nIn our patient, the addition of the Led in the presence of atorvastatin could have further increased the levels of colchicine, increasing the likelihood of muscle toxicity and causing rhabdomyolysis. Colchicine is renally eliminated and requires dose adjustments based on renal dysfunction. Thus, this patient's stage III CKD combined with a high colchicine dose and P-gp mediated drug interactions could have played a critical role in increasing the chance of this unanticipated toxicity [8]. There was little concern for mitochondrial toxicity caused by a lactic acidosis as the patient has a normal anion gap and normal lactate levels.\\n\\nThe Naranjo probability score [9] was developed to help assess causality for adverse drug reactions and based on score of 6 (Table 2) this patient's adverse event correlates with a probable adverse drug reaction. Although atorvastatin levels were directly measured, the muscle toxicity described was likely attributed to drug interactions in combination with preexisting renal impairment. Sof/Led was coadministered with two drugs known to cause myositis. Drug interactions, via P-gp inhibition, caused increased levels of all drugs, potentially increasing the risk of muscle problem development. It is important for physicians' prescribing Sof/Led to be aware of the potential drug interactions.\"], hint: None\n",

If rhabdomyolysis is discovered in a patient taking atorvastatin, Sof/Led, and/or colchicine, it should be treated with IV fluids and the CK levels should be trended. In addition, colchicine should be stopped, as there are other treatments for an acute gout flare (such as prednisone) that do not have a drug-drug interaction with atorvastatin and Sof/Led in causing rhabdomyolysis. In the setting of symptomatic rhabdomyolysis in a patient with no active coronary disease, atorvastatin should be stopped and can be resumed once the Sof/Led therapy is completed.\\n\\nCompeting Interests\\nThe authors declare no competing interests.\\n\\nFigure 1 Timeline of laboratory changes.

      "Predicting with title: Genetic risks to nicotine dependence predict negative mood and affect in current non-smokers., context: ['Nicotine is the psychoactive agent involved in nicotine dependence. However, nicotine as a drug, and its effects on human psychology are largely under-investigated in genetic studies. In this study, we recruited 208 current non-smokers to evaluate the effect of nicotine and its relationship to genetic risks to nicotine dependence. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, as well as measurement invariance testing, were conducted to evaluate the latent factor structures of the POMS, PANAS and DEN questionnaires across 3 nicotine doses. Structural models were used to examine the effects of nicotine and their relationship to genetic risks of nicotine dependence. We found that nicotine administration led to the change of both measurement construct and factor means, indicating the causal effect of nicotine on the psychological responses. The genotypes of rs588765 predicted the scores of the DEN Confused and Dizzy factors (p = 0.0003 and 0.001 respectively), and rs16969968 and rs588765 were associated with the PANAS Nervous factor (p = 0.006 and 0.007 respectively). Our study suggested that genetic risk of nicotine dependence is associated with acute psychological responses. The integration of psychometric analyses and dose effects could be a powerful approach for genetic study of nicotine dependence.\\n\\nIn the last several years, genetic studies of smoking and nicotine dependence have made significant progress, exemplified by the identification of the CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4 locus. Genetic variants at this locus have been shown to be associated with a number of smoking phenotypes such as the number of cigarettes smoked per day1234, nicotine dependence as defined by DSM IV56 and the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence78, age of smoking onset5910 and plasma cotinine concentration11. This locus includes the CHRNA5, CHRNA3 and CHRNB4 genes. While a non-synonymous SNP, rs16969968, in the CHRNA5 gene has emerged as a functional candidate, it may not be the one tagging the strongest association signal12. Further analyses reveal that there are multiple statistically independent association signals at this locus, represented by SNPs rs16969968, rs588765 and rs57877613.'], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: Genetic risks to nicotine dependence predict negative mood and affect in current non-smokers., context: ['Nicotine, the primary psychoactive substance in cigarette smoke, has broad psychological effects on humans14. When first exposed to nicotine, either by smoking or other routes of administration, some people feel pleasant and relaxed, while others feel dizzy and nauseous. These initial responses to nicotine have significant impacts on sustained smoking and subsequent development of nicotine dependence15161718. However, in a typical genetic study, the psychological effects of nicotine are rarely utilized and included in association testing. This omission is due, in part, to the fact that little is known of the relationship between these effects and genetic risks of nicotine dependence. In the literature, there are a few reports on the association between subjective measures and genetic variants in the nicotinic receptors, and some nominal associations are found in the CHRNB3/CHRNA619 and CHRNB220 genes. These studies use the scores of individual items or several items that contribute to a common factor, but these studies do not control for measurement errors and correlations between items, and do not have nicotine dose effect information.\\n\\nPsychometric analysis with structural equation modeling provides a framework for constructing latent factor structures that can take into account measurement errors, item residual correlations and the degree of invariance across multiple waves of data simultaneously. In theory, it can identify and differentiate “true” treatment responses from confounding effects, attribute responses directly to experimental treatments (nicotine administration and dosage), and permit the test of genetic effects on these responses. Thus, integration of structural modeling with association testing may improve statistical power when well targeted hypotheses are postulated. To demonstrate the utility and advantage of this approach, we conducted a pilot study to evaluate the relationship between genetic risks of nicotine dependence and the subjective responses resulting from nicotine administration. We hypothesized that genetic risks of nicotine dependence contributed to subjective responses, and that by integrating psychometric modeling of psychological effects and dose effects we could improve statistical power to detect this genetic association. In a lab setting, we recruited 208 non-smokers, and measured their psychological responses via self-report by the Profile of Mood State (POMS)21, the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS)22, and the Direct Effects of Nicotine scale (DEN)23 after administration of each of a series of nicotine doses. We used the 3\\u2005SNPs (rs16969968, rs588765 and rs578776) that were shown to be associated independently with smoking quantity at the CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4 locus13 as an example. In this article, we report the results of this pilot study.\\n\\nResults'], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: Genetic risks to nicotine dependence predict negative mood and affect in current non-smokers., context: [\"Our primary goals were to evaluate how nicotine administration influenced subject's mood and affect as measured by the POMS, PANAS and DEN, and whether mood states and affect were influenced by genetic risks of nicotine dependence using the established markers from the CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4 locus. Towards these goals, we needed first to examine the latent factor structures of the items of the instruments, and to evaluate whether the latent measurement factor structures remained equivalent (i.e. statistically invariant) after the administration of different nicotine doses using measurement invariance (MI) testing procedures. A failure in the MI testing would provide evidence that the latent factor(s) and the individual differences they represent were not constructed equivalently across the nicotine administrations, i.e., individual differences on the latent factors were not calibrated in the same way across administrations, presumably due to differential item responses attributable to the administration of different amounts of nicotine. Second, given the factor structures, we could test the association between the factors and genetic variants, and compare effects of the association across different dosage.\\n\\nExploratory factor analyses of the POMS, PANAS and DEN\\nAfter removing poorly responded to items, we conducted exploratory factor analyses (EFA) for the POMS, PANAS and DEN item sets. In the analyses of the POMS, 24 items were included. Specifically, we conducted exploratory analyses for the 0\\u2005mg, 2\\u2005mg and 4\\u2005mg gum sessions separately, extracting 3-, 4-, 5- and 6-factor solutions respectively. A 5-factor solution fit the data adequately as judged by the root mean square of the residuals (RMSR), root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) and χ2 test collectively (Table S1). For example, for the 0\\u2005mg nicotine administration, compared to the 4-factor solution, the 5-factor solution had better χ2\"], hint: None\n",

EFAs of the 2 and 4\\u2005mg of nicotine administration showed the same results. Further examination revealed that while the items consistently loaded onto the same factors (configural invariance), some loadings displayed differences across the 3 nicotine dosages (Table S2). The 5-factor solution included 3 positive and 2 negative factors. The first positive factor, labeled Friendly, consisted of 7 items (Friendly, Considerate, Efficient, Helpful, Cheerful, Good Natured and Trusting). The second positive factor, labeled Active, consisted of the items of Lively, Active, Energetic, Full of Pep and Vigorous. The third positive factor, labeled Clear Headed, was contributed by 3 items (Clear Headed, Unable to Concentrate (negative loading), and Alert). The negative factors were called On Edge (Tense, On Edge, Uneasy, Restless and Unable to Concentrate) and Fatigued (Worn out, Fatigued and Sluggish). It appeared that the loadings for the Friendly and Active factors changed significantly across the 3 nicotine gum doses while the Clear Headed, Uneasy and Fatigued factors remained stable (Table S2). In the literature, there was a report of a 5-factor structure of the POMS among smokers and non-smokers24. Generally, the POMS items typically are reported to have 6 distinct factors2125. In our EFA using 6-factor solutions, Sympathetic and Care Free had substantial loadings (~0.5) on the 6th factors, but other item's loadings on this sixth factor were below 0.2. For this reason, they were excluded from further analyses.\"], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: Genetic risks to nicotine dependence predict negative mood and affect in current non-smokers., context: ['Similar analyses were done for the PANAS. The EFA results pointed to a 3-factor structure based on the RMRS, RMSEA, TLI and χ2 test (Table S3). The 3-factor model, after the administration of 0\\u2005mg of nicotine, had reasonable absolute fit (RMRS, 0.04) and comparative fit (TLI, 0.075). While the 4-factor model had better absolute and comparative fits comparing to the 3-factor model, no indicator had a reasonable factor loading (maximal λ = 0.42 for all indicators) on the fourth factor. The models for the 2 and 4\\u2005mg of nicotine showed the same pattern. Therefore, we decided on the 3-factor solution. The first positive affect factor, labeled Inspired, included the following items: Interested, Excited, Enthusiastic, Proud, Strong, Determined, Inspired and Active. The second positive factor, Attentive, had strong loadings for the items of Interested, Alert, Attentive and Active. Two items, Interested and Active, had substantial cross loading on both factors. The negative factor, Nervous, consisted of the items Distressed, Nervous, Jittery, Afraid and Irritable. The loadings of individual items were also consistent across the 3 nicotine doses (Table S4). Typically, the PANAS shows a 2-factor structure, but in different type of samples, latent structures of more than 2 factors have been reported26. We did not find any report of structural analysis of PANAS with smokers or with nicotine treatment.\\n\\nThe EFAs of the DEN suggested a 2-factor structure (Table S5). All 10 items had significant loadings (range from 0.23 ~ 0.78) on the first factor. Two items, Dizzy and Light Headed, had significantly higher loadings (0.82–0.94) on a second factor. The cross loadings between the two factors were substantial (Table S6). When forcing a single factor structure, the overall fit was worse than that of a two-factor solution (for example, for the models after administration of 0\\u2005mg of nicotine, 1-factor model: RMRS 0.06, TLI 0.873, and χ2 p value 1.9E-14; 2-factor model: RMRS 0.03, TLI 0.964, and χ2 p value 5.8E-3, Table S5). For this reason, we choose the 2-factor model in the subsequent analyses. The 2 factors were Confused and Dizzy. The Confused factor had 7 items (Nauseous, Nervous, Sweaty, Headache, Salivation, Heart Pound, and Confused), and the Dizzy factor had 3 items (Dizzy, Lite Headed and Weak).\\n\\nInvariance tests for the POMS, PANAS and DEN models'], hint: None\n",

      "Predicting with title: Transient complete visual loss after intracameral anesthetic injection in cataract surgery., context: [\"On the first post-operative morning, the patient complained of not being able to see anything. His vision was recorded as having no light perception. The RAPD was found to be 4+. The fundus was examined under full pupillary dilation. The retina appeared normal, and the optic disc was not edematous. In the afternoon, the patient's visual acuity (VA) was improved to 3-m count-finger. On the second postoperative morning, the patient's VA was improved to 4/10. Vision assessment on the early morning of the third postoperative day was surprising. The patient's VA had improved to 20/20 without RAPD, and all other ocular examinations were normal.\\n\\nDiscussion\\nThe preferred technique for cataract surgeons in the United States is topical anesthesia (37%; range 22–63%). In a survey conducted by David Learning,1 76% of respondents preferred using topical anesthesia with intracameral lidocaine injection. Intracameral unpreserved lidocaine augments analgesia and significantly decreases intraoperative pain perception. Lidocaine is a useful adjunct, particularly in cases involving pupillary manipulation and peripheral iridectomy.\\n\\nWhile lidocaine has been reported to be safe and effective,2, 3 temporary visual loss4, 5, 6 and retinal toxicity4, 6 following the use of intracameral lidocaine have been highlighted in recent reports. An increased possibility of adverse effects of lidocaine on the retina and optic nerve is introduced in the event of compromise to the posterior lens capsule.4\\n\\nOur patient had experienced transient visual loss while receiving intracameral lidocaine and had an associated posterior capsule rupture, which has an incidence of between 26% and 36% in posterior polar cataract surgeries.7, 8 Normally, during cataract surgery, the lens capsule, zonules, and vitreous humor have a barrier effect against instilled intracameral lidocaine, and hence, the retina will not be affected. Pars plana lensectomy and vitrectomy facilitate the diffusion of the lidocaine into the posterior chamber.4\\n\\nGills et\\xa0al.9 reported amaurosis in four patients following the use of intracameral lidocaine, and in each case, the posterior capsule was not intact. All four patients recovered completely within hours. Hoffman and Fine4 reported on a patient with complete visual loss after intracameral lidocaine to repair a traumatic corneal graft dehiscence with a capsular tear, which was fully recovered several hours postoperatively. Falzon et\\xa0al.10 reported a case of transient, complete loss of vision following phacoemulsification with an intracameral ophthalmic viscosurgical device (OVD) and lidocaine solution complicated by posterior capsule rupture, which improved to 20/80 after one day and 20/25 in one week.\\n\\nFull recovery of visual acuity in our patient required three days, in contrast to the majority of reports (Table 1) with capsular tear4, 9 that had complete VA improvements within hours. The longer time span in recovery of VA in our patient might be explained by a higher volume of lidocaine that was diffused in the vitreous.\"], hint: None\n",

Schechter5 reported a case of inadvertent intraocular lidocaine injection with an immediate visual acuity of NLP (no light perception) that improved to 20/40 after one day and to 20/20 in one week.\\n\\nToxicity of lidocaine to rodent retinal ganglion cells has been documented.11 Lidocaine affects the pigment transport in retinal cells of crayfish and frogs. This inhibition is probably due to an anesthetic-induced disruption of intercellular ionic balance and increased plasma membrane permeability. Furthermore, intravitreal injection of lidocaine has also been investigated in cats, rabbits, and rats.6, 12, 13 In these animal studies, the electroretinogram analyses revealed a reversible reduction in the amplitude and extinguished b-waves which fully recovered within 10–24\\xa0h. In cats, intravitreal injection of lidocaine has been followed with vacuolization of nerve layers and presence of microscopic lesions in synapses between horizontal, bipolar cells, and photoreceptors. In addition, histopathological retinal structure changes near the injection sites have been detected.\\n\\nOne limitation of our study is that the patient did not consent to perform the ERG and mfERG tests. However, in the presence of positive RAPD, normal retinal examination, and full recovery of vision, the most plausible cause of vision loss would be attributed to lidocaine retinal toxicity. In view of the above, when posterior capsular rupture occurs, it is wise not to repeat intracameral lidocaine to minimize potential retinal toxicity risks.\\n\\nFunding\\nThe authors did not receive any financial support from any public or private sources.

The safe upper limit for daily dosing has variably been thought to be 4000 mg/day or possibly less.2 Excessive APAP dosing can occur with intent of self-harm (suicide attempt) or unintentionally while seeking pain relief, typically for a period of several days by using increased amounts each day.3, 4 Early on, an association was made between alcohol abuse and APAP unintentional overdoses, referred to initially as therapeutic misadventure.5 Both intentional and unintentional APAP overdoses have been shown to be associated with substance abuse of both alcohol and opioids, particularly the opioid (hydrocodone/acetaminophen) combination products.6 In 1 study of 275 APAP-related ALF patients, 55% had a history of alcohol use and 35% a history of alcohol abuse, and 53% had taken an opioid-APAP combination product.4 In a follow-up study of a larger cohort of 306 APAP toxicity survivors, 55% had a history of psychiatric disease compared with only 27% of non-APAP survivors, 46% of APAP patients had a history of prior substance abuse vs 15% of non-APAP patients, and 14% had a specific history of injection drug use vs 8% for the non-APAP group.7 Understanding what determines these behaviors might lead to better identification of high-risk patients and development of prevention strategies.\\n\\nWith either intentional or unintentional etiologies, critical behavioral differences could lead to high-risk behaviors. Impulsivity is a character trait defined as “acting suddenly in an unplanned manner to satisfy a desire,” ie, not thinking things through to understand the potential impact of a decision. More recently, impulsivity has been recognized as a measurable trait that is correlated with a variety of addictive behaviors.8 We have recently shown that higher impulsivity scores on the Barratt impulsivity scale are detected in both intentional and unintentional APAP overdoses when compared with control populations (Sanders C, Lee WM, unpublished data, submitted for publication).'], hint: None\n",

We hypothesized that this polymorphism or others that are related may have an impact in patients with APAP overdoses, especially in patients who have multiple substance dependencies. Furthermore, we speculated that the genetic association may be stronger or more apparent in subjects with intentional APAP overdose compared with those with nonintentional overdose. Thus, variations in several of these genes that alter the host’s ability to respond to stressful situations may indeed correlate with the observed tendency of addictive behavior.\\n\\nThe Acute Liver Failure Study Group (ALFSG) (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00518440) has been prospectively identifying and studying the etiologies, presenting features, and clinical outcomes of adults with ALF during the past 17 years while collecting biosamples—serum, plasma, and DNA. During this time period, ALFSG has enrolled more than 3000 subjects in its registry, 46% of whom suffered from severe or fatal APAP liver injury. Because stress and the response to stress are closely linked to addictive behavior and APAP toxicity patients have frequently been identified as substance abusers, we sought to determine whether specific variants in stress-related genes are over-represented in an APAP overdose cohort compared with population controls. By using DNA from 229 of these APAP subjects, we sought to identify whether selective variants in genes related to stress/impulsivity and addiction are associated with APAP overdose cases, because these findings might shed light on the patients’ tendency to abuse APAP products.\\n\\nMethods\\nPatients'], hint: None\n",

The algorithm includes the following specific criteria: a history of APAP ingestion, detection of APAP in plasma, biochemical pattern that is consistent with APAP toxicity with high serum aminotransferase levels (≥1000 IU/L) along with total bilirubin <10.0 mg/dL at presentation, and, if available, presence of APAP-Cys adducts.

However, GAD antibodies alone appear to be insufficient to cause SPS, and they possibly are involved in only part of its pathophysiology. It is suspected that the symptoms of SPS get precipitated by external stimuli. Here, we briefly introduce the case of a patient with latent autoimmune diabetes who developed SPS through the action of subcutaneously injected insulin. A 43-year-old man was diagnosed with diabetes and initially well-controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents but progressed to requiring insulin within 1 year of diagnosis. Two months after the initiation of basal insulin therapy, he presented with abdominal stiffness and painful muscle spasms, involving the lower limbs, which resulted in walking difficulty, and thus, he refused insulin injections thereafter. He had been treated with oral anti-diabetic agents instead of insulin for 10 years until premixed insulin twice daily was started again due to poor diabetes control. Immediately after insulin injection, abdominal muscle rigidity and spasms were noted. When insulin was not administered, frequent episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis occurred. Serum GAD antibody test was positive and there was no positivity for islet antigen-2 antibody. A glucagon stimulation test demonstrated relative insulin deficiency, indicative of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA). Tolerable muscle rigidity was achieved when the dosage of basal insulin was split into two separate daily injections with lower amounts of units per injection. This case highlights a different form of autoimmune diabetes in SPS.

      "Predicting with title: Exogenous Insulin Injection-Induced Stiff-Person Syndrome in a Patient With Latent Autoimmune Diabetes: A Case Report and Literature Review., context: ['Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a rare autoimmune neurological disorder and highly associated with glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody (GAD-Ab) positivity. Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the predominant inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. In the neuron, GABA is synthesized in the cytosol from its precursor glutamate by the enzyme glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) and then transported into the synaptic vesicles (1–3). The blockade of GAD, a critical enzyme involved in inhibitory pathways, and subsequent decline in the levels of GABA in the central nervous system have been suggested to be associated with a loss of neural inhibition, although evidence for a causative link between GAD antibodies and SPS pathogenesis is still lacking (1). GAD is the rate-limiting enzyme for the synthesis of GABA. SPS is characterized by progressive muscle stiffness, rigidity, and spasm involving the truncal and proximal limb muscles, resulting in severely impaired ambulation (4). It is suspected that the symptoms of SPS get precipitated by external stimuli, such as sounds, stress, and emotional upheaval (1, 5). The diagnosis of SPS is based on the detection of typical clinical findings, GAD antibody positivity, and suggestive ancillary investigations. GAD is also found in non-neuronal tissues, such as pancreatic beta cells, testes, and oviducts, so SPS is also associated with other endocrine disorders (6, 7). It has been shown that ~45% of patients with SPS have type 1 diabetes (T1D), which is an autoimmune disease characterized by the immune-mediated loss of the insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells (1, 5, 8, 9). SPS and T1D share human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genetic risk, with most SPS patients possessing the DQ2 phenotype (10). Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) shares clinical and metabolic characteristics with both T1D and type 2 diabetes (T2D). According to the criteria of LADA diagnosis, LADA is defined by the absence of insulin requirement for at least 6 months after diagnosis and exhibits an older age of onset, as well as a slower progression toward insulin dependence compared to subjects with T1D (11, 12). LADA in SPS is rarely described (13). Here, we reported a case of SPS in a patient with LADA. To our knowledge, this is the first report of SPS described shortly after the initiation of insulin therapy that required to split the administration of basal insulin into two separate injections (with lower amounts of insulin units per each injection) to achieve tolerable muscle symptoms and better glucose control, without the development of diabetic ketoacidosis.\\n\\nCase Report'], hint: None\n",

However, within 1 year, he was started on subcutaneous insulin injections (Insulatard, isophane Neutral Protamine Hagedorn human insulin, twice daily). Two months after the initiation of insulin therapy, he presented with abdominal stiffness, painful spasms extending to lower limbs, and impaired walking ability. Neurological examination showed muscle rigidity and bilateral contractures in the lower limbs but no muscular weakness. Electroencephalography was normal, and electromyography/nerve conduction velocity revealed slightly asymmetrical motor and sensory polyneuropathy with demyelination. These features were highly indicative of SPS. Therefore, diazepam (10 mg/day in two divided oral doses), clonazepam (2 mg orally four times daily), baclofen (10 mg two times daily), and phenobarbital (30 mg two times daily) were administered to treat muscle rigidity.\\n\\nThe patient's symptoms of jerky myoclonus-like movement, abdominal stiffness with painful spasms, and muscle rigidity were exacerbated by sound, anxiety, and subcutaneous insulin injections, regardless of the treatment regimen (Insulatard or regular insulin). Thus, he refused insulin therapy, resulting in poor glycemic control for 10 years, which resulted in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values persistently >8.0% (64 mmol/mol) with only oral anti-diabetic drugs (metformin 2,000 mg/day, sitagliptin 100 mg/day, glimepiride 8 mg/day, and acarbose 200 mg/day). Therefore, basal insulin (insulin glargine, 0.43 IU/Kg/day) with oral anti-diabetic agents (metformin 1,500 mg/day and gliclazide MR 240 mg/day) followed by premixed insulin twice daily (Humalog Mix 25, 0.71 IU/Kg/day) or a basal-bolus injection regimen (insulin detemir 0.17 IU/Kg/day and insulin aspart 0.13 IU/Kg/day) were introduced since 2015. He consistently experienced muscle rigidity with subcutaneous insulin injections every time. His fear and anxiety of re-experiencing muscle stiffness resulted in poor compliance with the prescribed therapeutic regimens. Finally, he experienced two episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis in 2017 (BMI was 22.45 kg/m2) and the laboratory results are summarized in Table 1. His GAD65-Ab level was positive (110 units/mL), insulin antibodies (IAs) were positive (13.7%), while islet antigen-2 (IA2) autoantibodies were within the normal range. A thyroid function test revealed euthyroidism, and antithyroid peroxidase Abs were positive (18.81 IU/mL). A 6 min-glucagon stimulation test was performed under stable clinical conditions and demonstrated insulin deficiency (basal C-peptide levels, 0.26 ng/mL; stimulated C-peptide levels 0.41 ng/mL), which was compatible with a diagnosis of LADA.\\n\\nTable 1 Results of laboratory tests.\"], hint: None\n",

The presence of high-titers of GAD autoantibodies has been reported in more than 85% of patients with SPS (1, 14, 15). GAD is involved in the synthesis of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma aminobutyric acid in the central nervous system (CNS). Dysfunction of GABA input in motor neurons causes stiffness, rigidity, and painful spasms (16). GABAergic neuron dysfunction has also been reported in epilepsy, and 10% of patients with SPS have some form of epilepsy (1, 16). From preclinical and animal models, it has been hypothesized that autoimmune responses against GAD in pancreatic islet deplete this enzyme and reduce GABA levels within the GABAergic system in the endocrine pancreas, thus promoting the progression of T1D. Moreover, GABA has been shown to exert β-cell regenerative effects, protecting β-cells against apoptosis induced by cytokines, drugs, and other stresses, and exerting anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory effects (17). The GAD-Abs are believed to play a role in the possible relationship between epilepsy and T1D (18). Two major isoforms of GAD enzyme exist, namely GAD65, and GAD67, which catalyze the formation of GABA at different locations in the cell and different time periods of development. GAD65 is attached to the surface of synaptic vesicles in GABAergic neurons or microvesicles in the pancreatic beta-cells, while GAD67 is a soluble form detectable only in the CNS (19). Anti-GAD antibodies are detected in up to 80% of SPS patients, while antibodies against the GAD67 isoform occur in <50% of patients and at much lower levels (19, 20).'], hint: None\n",

The inflammation and the impaired oligodendrocyte function lead to neuronal dysfunction and precipitate cell death. The misfolded α-synuclein exhibits prion-like properties and can spread to other brain areas. Depending on the affected site the clinical presentation varies: striatonigral degeneration presents as parkinsonism with poor response to levodopa, olivopontocerebellar atrophy with cerebellar syndrome and degeneration of the brain stem and the medullary autonomic nuclei with failure of the autonomous system.\\n\\nIn our report, we describe a 55-year-old female MSA patient, presenting with a persistent febrile syndrome, who was diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).\\n\\n2 Case presentation\\nA 55-year-old female patient of Greek origin was admitted in our hospital due to a recurring febrile syndrome up to 39oC during the week before the admission for which the family physician had prescribed ciprofloxacin for presumptive urinary tract infection in the context of intermittent bladder catheterizations without resolution of the symptoms.\\n\\nThe patient was diagnosed with probable MSA with onset 2 years before presentation. Initially, urinary incontinence was attributed to genitourinary syndrome of menopause and due to failure to manage with medical treatment the patient resorted to intermittent bladder catheterization. Symptoms progressed with frequent falls and documentation of orthostatic hypotension and finally, parkinsonism. The disease was not responsive to levodopa treatment and a DaT scan was not consistent with Parkinson's disease.\\n\\nPatient history was also notable for asthma, hypothyroidism, depression, placental abruption, and endoscopic resection of multiple benign colon polyps.\\n\\nAt presentation the patient was unwell without any specific complaints and febrile with marked orthostatic hypotension and normal oxygen saturation. Clinical examination was unremarkable except for the neurological status where no modifications with respect to the patient's baseline were noted. The complete blood cell count on admission was notable for normocytic anemia with low reticulocyte count (Hemoglobin 9.8\\u200ag/dl). Renal function was normal and hypokalemia (K 2.9 mEq/l) as well as hyponatremia (Na 128 mEq/l) with low specific gravity as a surrogate for urine osmolality and low urine sodium (21 mEq/l) were documented. Serum lactate was normal. A chest X-ray demonstrated limited infiltrations in the left lower pulmonary field.\"], hint: None\n",

Repeated blood and urinary cultures were negative and due to the persisting febrile syndrome, without evidence of focus of infection a total body computed tomography (CT) scan and a transthoracic ultrasound were conducted without contributive findings. The infectious diseases work-up came back negative; despite negative antinuclear antibodies and anti-double stranded (ds) DNA antibodies, the complement was low. Serum protein electrophoresis documented presence of a multiclonal gammopathy and a bone marrow biopsy was not contributive.\\n\\nDue to the persistence of fever in face of a clinical deterioration of the patient after 2 weeks of hospitalization new sets of cultures were drawn and the antimicrobial treatment was escalated. Repeat urinalysis was positive for proteinuria in the absence of an active sediment. In 24 h-urine collection, a total protein of 783\\u200amg was quantified. A repeat evaluation for antinuclear antibodies was positive with a titer of 1:640 and positive anti-ds DNA along with low complement. Given the neurological status, we conducted brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which did not reveal abnormal findings and it was decided not to proceed with lumbar puncture. Taking into consideration the complexity of the case and the presence of proteinuria a renal biopsy was deemed necessary and documented mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis, thus, substantiating the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus flare. Pending the biopsy result, treatment with hydroxychloroquine and corticosteroids (equivalent of methylprednisolone 1\\u200amg/kg/day) was initiated. Due to failure to achieve remission, azathioprine was added, but symptoms persisted. Following the diagnosis of lupus nephritis, azathioprine was discontinued and induction treatment with cyclophosphamide in accordance with the Euro-Lupus regimen was initiated. Corticosteroids were tapered gradually. The patient responded after the first cycle of cyclophosphamide and was discharged after 40 days of hospitalization, but fever recurred five days before the 2nd cycle. A second hospitalization followed and after the third cycle there was no recurrence of the fever. Upon completion of the Euro-Lupus regimen, maintenance therapy with mycophenolate mofetil was initiated.

Although our patient fell short of fulfilling the classic criteria of fever of unknown origin (FUO) as clues to the diagnosis were provided by the low complement and the autoantibodies, the prolonged febrile syndrome without substantial elements to guide the differential diagnosis except for the lack of chills in patient with multiple potential foci of infection due to her debilitating disease.[3,4]\\n\\nThe intermittent bladder catheterization in the setting of neurogenic bladder dysfunction is a well-established risk factor for urinary tract infection but the diagnosis was not corroborated.[5] Neither was a respiratory tract infection, despite the potential for micro-aspirations in a bedridden patient with deterioration of her neurological disease.[6] Other infectious causes were ruled out through reevaluation of the patient history and a targeted work-up. Nevertheless, the prolonged fever of the patient along with episodes of hypotension given the impaired autonomic system response in a context of high prevalence of nosocomial infections and increased antimicrobial resistance, mandated the use of broad spectrum antibiotics and the escalation of the antimicrobial treatment.\\n\\nThe work-up we undertook did not provide evidence to a neoplastic origin of this febrile syndrome, but clues to an auto-immune disorder. Fever as a manifestation of SLE occurs frequently but it rarely is the sole manifestation of SLE at presentation and frequently it responds to corticosteroids.[7] Given the deterioration in the clinical status and the proteinuria in the absence of other manifestations to substantiate the diagnosis coupled with the presence of anti-ds DNA antibodies,[8] we resorted to renal biopsy which corroborated the diagnosis of SLE in accordance with the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics classification criteria (SLICC).[9]\\n\\nSystemic lupus erythematosus is a multisystem autoimmune disease notorious for its protean manifestations,[10] whereas a definitive diagnosis of multiple system atrophy can only be made through brain biopsy.[2] Thus, we considered the possibility that the constellation of symptoms in our patient may be in part manifestations of systematic lupus erythematosus.[11] We believe that the clinical course of the patient spanning years before the flare, the lack of abnormal findings in the MRI of the patient and the lack of response of the neurological syndrome to a treatment regimen that induced and maintained long term remission reasonably exclude the possibility that the principal components of the neurological syndrome are associated with SLE.\\n\\nIn our literature search, we found no previous reports of co-existence of multiple system atrophy and systemic lupus erythematosus and current evidence do not seem to lend support to a shared pathogenesis.\\n\\nAuthor contributions\\nConceptualization: Dimitrios Pilalas, Georgia D.

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Non-Commercial, No Derivatives (CC BY-NC-ND) license.\\n\\nResistance to antipsychotic treatment is defined as failure to respond to two antipsychotics of adequate dose and duration1 and occurs in 30% of individuals with schizophrenia.2 Clozapine is the only medication with evidence-based effectiveness in treatment-resistant schizophrenia,1 being effective in 50–60% of cases,3 but is also associated with a broad range of adverse effects. A commonly accepted risk is clozapine-induced blood dyscrasia, typically neutropenia or agranulocytosis. Neutropenia is defined as a neutrophil count of less than 1.5×109/L, occurring at a rate of 2.7% of clozapine users at 1 year.4 Patients who develop neutropenia may develop flu-like symptoms such as sore throat and pyrexia, with the peak risk occurring at 6–18 weeks. Less common is agranulocytosis, a life-threatening event defined as a neutrophil count of less than 0.5×109/L, occurring in approximately 0.8% of clozapine users at 1 year.4\\n\\nDispensing of clozapine is dependent on a satisfactory full blood count (FBC) result and maintenance of normal white blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil counts during clozapine treatment. In established clozapine-induced neutropenia or agranulocytosis, clozapine is immediately discontinued, and given the increased risk of recurrence,5 re-challenge is contraindicated. However, re-challenge may be attempted under certain conditions, for example, due to an alternative cause of the reduced neutrophil count being identified, or after careful assessment of the clinical risks and benefits. This process involves collaboration with a haematologist and may involve the co-administration of lithium or granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCS-F) in an attempt to promote granulocyte proliferation and increase the WBC and neutrophil counts. Despite carefully controlled re-challenge, a third of patients will develop a further blood dyscrasia, which is often more rapid in onset and more severe.5\\n\\nIn this report, we add to the limited existing evidence of successfully re-challenging clozapine for a third time with a patient with treatment-resistant schizoaffective disorder, following two episodes of agranulocytosis and one of episode of neutropenia.\\n\\nCase report'], hint: None\n",

Over the next decade, she had multiple admissions to psychiatric hospitals, both informally and under Section 3 of the Mental Health Act. Her illness was characterised by mixed affective episodes associated with persecutory delusions, thought disorder and auditory hallucinations, often triggered by stress or periods of non-adherence to medication. During admission to our service, persecutory beliefs were about other patients, staff and visitors, and led to accusations of theft of her belongings, accusations of sexual assault and physical aggression. Periodically, she became suspicious about the side-effects of medications and declined to adhere to their administration. There was a significant labile component to her mood, fluctuating between laughing and verbal or physical aggression. Between episodes, J.B. was pleasant, engaged in recovery-oriented practices and appeared less preoccupied and distressed by positive psychotic symptoms.\\n\\nDuring the first 7 years of her illness, J.B. was treated with multiple antipsychotics (i.e. quetiapine, aripiprazole, risperidone, olanzapine, amisulpride, haloperidol, sulpiride, zuclopenthixol decanoate and flupentixol decanoate), mood stabilisers (lithium carbonate and sodium valproate) and a course of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) with minimal improvement documented in case notes.

WBC and neutrophil counts remained within normal limits until week 17, when J.B. developed agranulocytosis with a nadir WBC count of 2.0×109/L and a neutrophil count of 0.41×109/L. The daily dose of clozapine was 300 mg, with a plasma clozapine concentration of 0.17 mg/dL. Clozapine was immediately stopped and olanzapine was commenced as an alternative. The blood dyscrasia persisted for 19 days in total before cell counts recovered. Case records from the previous hospital indicated a significant improvement in her clinical state with clozapine, and discontinuation was associated with a rapid increase in her psychotic symptoms.\\n\\nTrial 2\\nA second clozapine challenge was initiated in February 2012. Sodium valproate was discontinued prior to the second clozapine trial. At this time, J.B. was concurrently treated with olanzapine 10 mg and lithium carbonate 300 mg daily. An FBC prior to re-challenge with clozapine showed a WBC count of 8.0×109/L and a neutrophil count of 4.4×109/L. Six weeks after re-commencement of clozapine, J.B. developed a neutropenia, with a nadir neutrophil count of 0.53×109/L and a WBC of 1.9×109/L. Clozapine was immediately discontinued following consultation with a haematologist. The neutrophil count normalised over the next 20 days, during which time she was treated with an increased dose of olanzapine 15 mg and sulpiride 200 mg daily.\\n\\nTrial 3\\nIn September 2012, after a careful risk–benefit assessment and in collaboration with a haematologist, a third clozapine trial was commenced.

Following consultation with a haematologist, J.B. continued clozapine treatment with an additional dose of filgrastim 480 mcg given that day. This resulted in a good response, with the neutrophil count increasing to 19.2×109/L and the WBC to 23.10×109/L the following day. A plan was formulated to increase the frequency of filgrastim injections to twice weekly in the event of further neutropenia; however, this was not required.

In October 2014, following specialist consultations, the multidisciplinary team agreed collaboratively with the patient and family to re-challenge with clozapine for a third time under close supervision. She was deemed to have capacity to be part of each of these decisions. Following consultation with a haematologist and pharmacist, lithium carbonate was commenced prior to clozapine initiation, and weekly FBCs were measured over the first year of clozapine treatment. It was planned that in the event of the neutrophil count dropping below 2×109/L, a single dose of 105 mcg of lenograstim was to be administered subcutaneously, and clozapine was to be continued with daily blood monitoring. In the event of the neutrophil count dropping below 1.5×109/L, a single dose of 105 mcg lenograstim was to be administered, and clozapine treatment immediately terminated. Lenograstim was to be used in preference to filgrastim because of increased experience with its use in our clinical setting.\\n\\nPre-treatment FBC demonstrated a WBC count of 8.43×109/L and a neutrophil count of 5.7×109/L. Standard clozapine titration was carried out as per Maudsley Guidelines,7 and clozapine was increased to a dose of 550 mg daily administered in liquid form. Lithium carbonate at 1200 mg daily was concurrently used, with serum lithium levels of 0.55–0.95 mmol/L attained. Weekly FBCs across the first year demonstrated stable WBC and neutrophil counts, with no episodes of neutropenia or the need for rescue lenograstim. Consistently, therapeutic plasma clozapine concentrations of around 0.35–0.40 mg/L were attained, without further haematological complications despite continuation of clozapine, and a dramatic improvement in mental state was observed.\\n\\nDiscussion\\nOwing to the severity and distressing nature of this young woman’s psychotic and mood symptoms and the lack of response to a number of antipsychotic medications, clozapine was re-challenged following specialist consultations and close monitoring practices. The results were promising given the failure of three previous attempts and thus support the need for measured re-challenging and augmentation practices. In a recent systematic review, clozapine re-challenge was successful in 70% (78/112 patients) after an episode of neutropenia, with 20% (3/15 patients) successfully re-challenged after agranulocytosis.8 The co-administration of lithium (33/35 patients) or GCS-F (7/11 patients), in a targeted strategy, decreased the likelihood of developing a further blood dyscrasia.8 We reported previously that a clozapine re-challenge was successful in 79% of patients (n=19) admitted to our service.9'], hint: None\n",

The first trial of clozapine was concurrent with the use of sodium valproate. Sodium valproate can cause a dose-dependent inhibition of granulopoiesis,11 which when combined with clozapine may have led to the agranulocytosis. In the second trial, clozapine re-challenge occurred in combination with lithium carbonate. Lithium carbonate has demonstrated the ability to increase circulating neutrophils and granulocyte colony formation.12–14 Although a neutropenia occurred during this trial, it is interesting to note that the neutrophil count did not drop as low as seen in the first trial. During the third trial, J.B. was treated with concurrent G-CSF, and although agranulocytosis still occurred, neutrophil recovery was 1 day, which was significantly shorter than the recovery seen in the first and second trials. We are unable to explain this transient episode of agranulocytosis and the lack of any recurrent neutropenia over the following 7 months of clozapine treatment with concurrent G-CSF (with no G-CSF dose change). We cannot exclude that a transient increase in plasma clozapine concentrations was related to the onset of agranulocytosis (we have no data relating to plasma clozapine concentrations at that time, nor do we know if the patient had ceased smoking at or around this time). Alternatively, the presence of a viral infection may have contributed to the onset of agranulocytosis, though this was not clinically documented.\\n\\nDuring the fourth trial, lithium carbonate was used with therapeutic serum levels attained. Previous work has suggested that serum lithium levels greater than 0.4 mmol/L are required for granulopoiesis.14 Given the low dose of lithium carbonate used during the second trial, it may be that there were insufficient lithium levels to promote granulocyte colony formation at that time and that the optimal serum lithium levels in the fourth trial supported the maintenance of normal neutrophil counts.\\n\\nDespite neutropenia and agranulocytosis being well-documented complications of clozapine treatment, the mechanism of action remains unclear.15 There are several hypotheses, but due to its idiosyncratic nature it has been difficult to perform mechanistic studies to investigate these in a systematic fashion. Clozapine-induced agranulocytosis (CIA) has a large genetic component; genetic data suggest dysfunction in the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) system, which comprises genes that modulate immune system function. Recent work has suggested that there is an association with several genetic variants in the HLA-DQB1 locus, a single amino acid at HLA-DQB1 (126Q) and an amino acid change in the extracellular binding pocket of HLA-B (158T).16'], hint: None\n",

The causative agent is the human polyomavirus JC virus (JCV), which infects oligodendrocytes and astrocytes [1]. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy usually occurs in patients with profound cellular immunodeficiencies, due to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or to immunosuppressive biotherapies such as natalizumab or rituximab for autoimmune diseases [1, 2]. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy is also a rare complication of solid organ transplantation. After renal transplantation, the estimated incidence of PML is 0.027%, the mortality rate is approximately 80%, and the median survival time is 6 months [3]. The only therapeutic approach with proven clinical efficacy is the restoration of JCV T-cell responses [1] through early withdrawal of immunosuppressive drugs. In this study, we describe a case of anti-JCV T-cell anergy that could not be reversed despite several therapeutic approaches and was associated with rapidly fatal PML in a renal transplant recipient on belatacept (a CD28-B7 costimulation blocker and T-cell anergy inducer).\\n\\nCASE REPORT\\nPreprogressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy History'], hint: None\n",

The immunosuppressive regimen included basiliximab induction and belatacept/mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)/corticosteroid maintenance. Belatacept was used because the kidney came from an extended-criteria donor [4]. Belatacept was administered intravenously, as recommended for the less intensive regimen (10 mg/kg on day 1 (D1), D5, week 2 (W2), W4, W8, W12; then beyond the third month, 5 mg/kg per month) [4]. During the posttransplantation period, the patient experienced multiple complications of viral reactivation, including cytomegalovirus disease at 7 months treated with valganciclovir; BK virus (BKV) reactivation at month 9 without polyomavirus-associated nephropathy on biopsy leading to a reduction in the MMF dosage (500 mg twice a day); and Epstein-Barr virus viremia at month 16 with no signs of a posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder. Fourteen months after transplantation, he received pulsed intravenous corticosteroids for cellular rejection (grade Ib). The estimated glomerular filtration rate stabilized at 53 mL/min per 1.73 m2 (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula). He had persistent lymphopenia, with median CD4 and CD8 T-cell counts of 183/µL and 115/µL, respectively.\\n\\nProgressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy\\nIn June 2015, 20 months after renal transplantation, he was admitted to Bicêtre hospital for left upper-limb weakness and visual disturbances. His family described mood disorders and confusion, which had started the month before. He developed progressive right-sided hemiparesis with temporospatial disorientation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed left frontoparietal subcortical white-matter lesions, without gadolinium enhancement, suggesting no vascular disease occurrence. These lesions were consistent with demyelination and suggested PML (Figure 1A). Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy was confirmed by the presence of JCV deoxyribonucleic acid in cerebrospinal fluid ([CSF] 7.15 × 103 copies/mL) ( Figure 1A). At PML diagnosis, he had lymphopenia (421 CD3 cells/µL), with 276 CD4 cells/µL and 145 CD8 cells/µL (Figure 1A). He was HIV seronegative. Mycophenolate mofetil was stopped when PML was confirmed. The last injection of belatacept was given 2 days before his admission. Because of the 2-week half-life of belatacept, we performed 2 plasma exchanges to hasten belatacept elimination, on D6 and D11 after PML diagnosis (Figure 1A). An intravenous perfusion of polyclonal Igs (0.5 g/kg per day for 2 days) was given for mild hypogammaglobulinemia (IgG level: 6 g/L). He rapidly developed complete right hemiplegia with aphasia, cortical blindness, and no understanding of simple orders. The PML worsened and the patient became bedridden.

As controls, we used 3 healthy donors who were responsive to JCV. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were incubated overnight with a pool of JCV peptides spanning the entire VP1 and VP2 regions that activate both CD4 and CD8 T-cells [5]. Cells were stained for surface markers and then fixed and permeabilized before being incubated with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. As shown in Figure 1B, TNF-α secretion was severely impaired at PML onset.\\n\\nWe tested the ability of CD4 and CD8 T cells to proliferate in response to JCV peptides. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stained with 0.5 µM carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester and then incubated for 5 days with JCV peptides. Specific T-cell proliferation was very weak (Figure 1C). To measure JCV-speciﬁc cytotoxicity, PBMCs were coincubated overnight with JCV peptide-coated autologous target cells. As control, cells were coincubated with uncoated autologous target cells. The mortality rate of target cells was evaluated by 7-amino-actinomycin D staining. No specific cytotoxicity was observed in the presence of JCV-specific peptides (Figure 1D). Despite the patient’s treatment, his T-cell responses to JCV remained weak throughout follow-up with no significant change (Figure 1B–D). We also assessed the expression of the inhibitory receptor programmed death-1 (PD-1). We found that the patient’s T cells expressed high levels of PD-1 up to day 61 (1 week before death) both ex vivo and after in vitro activation (Figure 2A). We then examined the effects of a neutralizing anti-PD-1 antibody (nivolumab) on T-cell proliferation in vitro. Programmed death-1 blockade failed to reverse this T-cell anergy (Figure 2B). Of interest, we tested in parallel a transplant recipient patient who had been receiving tacrolimus, MMF, and corticoids since November 2014. This patient developed BKV nephropathy along with BKV viremia (8.4 × 106 copies/mL) and was treated by replacing tacrolimus with everolimus (an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin) in April 2015. T lymphocytes from this patient were nonresponsive to BKV in vitro (Figure 2B) and expressed significant levels of PD-1 after BKV peptide activation (Figure 2A). In contrast to the PML patient on belatacept, who was refractory to PD-1 blockade, nivolumab significantly restored anti-BKV T-cell responsiveness in this second patient (Figure 2B).\\n\\nExpression of PD-1 and restoration of functionality after PD-1 neutralization is compatible with immune exhaustion [6].

(B) shows the lack of improvement in T-cell functionality after PD-1 blockade with nivolumab in the anergic PML patient compared with the control transplant recipient.\\n\\nDISCUSSION\\nThe first treatment aim in this patient was to reverse lymphopenia by withdrawing MMF (an inhibitor of T-cell proliferation) and by adding r-hIL-7. Interleukin-7 induces widespread T-cell proliferation, increased T-cell numbers, and a more diverse T-cell receptor repertoire. We recently reported the case of a PML patient with profound lymphopenia after allogenic bone marrow transplantation, in whom r-hIL-7 led to the recovery of effective polyfunctional JCV-specific T-cell responses, virus clearance from CSF, and a favorable clinical outcome [7]. In this study, r-hIL-7 had no significant effect on the CD4 and CD8 T-cell counts. The subsequent CD4 cell recovery would be due more to MMF withdrawal. However, the CD8 T-cell count remained low. The patient had been on belatacept for 20 months, resulting in a long-term lack of CD28-mediated costimulation. Belatacept, which can provide significantly better renal function and both patient and renal graft survival than calcineurin inhibitor-based immunosuppression [8], provokes T-cell anergy in vivo [9]. The CD4 T-cell count recovery observed in our patient was not associated with improved functionality in terms of cytokine secretion, proliferation, or cytotoxicity. These functional abnormalities persisted for 60 days after PML diagnosis (the patient died 69 days after PML diagnosis) and were associated with strong expression of the inhibitory receptor PD-1. However, treatment with a therapeutic anti-PD1 receptor antibody (nivolumab) ex vivo failed to improve T-cell function.'], hint: None\n",

Although mucosal bleeding is the most common, fatal bleeding complications are also possible. Thus, F5D increases the difficulty of invasive testing, and surgical and procedural treatments. When long-term antithrombotic drugs, including antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants, are required in patients at high risk of bleeding, one of the biggest challenges is coronary intervention to treat coronary artery disease. Most studies recommend preinterventional or preoperative supplementation with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to reduce bleeding risk.[2,3] However, in addition to the bleeding risk caused by antithrombotic therapy, the hypercoagulable state in coronary intervention has an adverse effect on stent thrombosis, mortality, and prognosis during the postinterventional period.[4] The contemporary standard therapy for significant coronary artery stenosis is implanting a drug-eluting stent (DES). However, because implanting a DES delays endothelial healing and requires long-term antithrombotic therapy, DES implantation in an F5D patient is very complex. No antithrombotic therapy study to date has been reported for F5D patients undergoing coronary stenting.

      "Predicting with title: Successful coronary stenting in a patient with factor V deficiency in the absence of fresh frozen plasma transfusion: Case report., context: ['Although F5D is defined as a mild and severe disease in cases with activity >5% and <1%, respectively, factor V activity does not necessarily predict bleeding severity or clinical features, and many patients may present with a mild disease even with factor V activity of <1%.[2] However, F5D therapy depends on the factor V activity level, and is classified as bleeding control and the removal of inhibitors or antibodies of factor V. FFP or platelet transfusion is recommended to control bleeding. In particular, transfusing FFP is recommended to maintain factor V activity at >25% to 30% in cases of bleeding, invasive testing, or surgery.[3,6] In this case, FFP was not transfused because coronary stenting was performed without knowledge of the degree of factor V activity or the existence of F5D. We recognized F5D due to hemoptysis, epistaxis, and hematochezia after coronary stenting. However, we first planned to reduce or modify the dosage of antithrombotic drugs due to the risk of stent thrombosis. This strategy was based on previous reports in which factor V activity was not related to bleeding severity.[2,6] Moreover, successful childbirth delivery was possible without an FFP transfusion, and the success rate for bleeding control was low with FFP transfusion.[3,6] Fortunately, mucosal bleeding in the present case was controlled by adjusting the antithrombotic drug dose. Treatments for the inhibitors or antibodies to factor V are another option and include plasmapheresis, immunosuppressants, steroids, intravenous globulins, and a monoclonal antibody.[2] Such therapies were not used in our case because the inhibitors and autoantibodies for factor V were unknown and such therapies have weak evidence.'], hint: None\n",

The ECMO was switched to a temporary VAD using ROTAFLOW (MAQUET GmbH & CO. KG, Rastatt, Germany). The histological examination of the LV apex revealed histiocytoid cardiomyopathy. She did not meet the criteria for a heart transplantation due to a suspected systemic condition (agenesis of corpus callosum and a pale optic nerve). Although the TdP occurred sporadically on amiodarone, the VAD improved the cardiac function (LVEF, 53%).

      "Predicting with title: Successful catheter ablation of premature ventricular contractions triggering torsade de pointes in a small infant with histiocytoid cardiomyopathy: a case report., context: ['Histiocytoid cardiomyopathy is a rare genetic cardiac disorder of infancy and childhood, predominantly affecting girls below the age of 2 years. Clinically, it is characterized by severe cardiac arrhythmias including WPW syndrome, VT, and/or VF, dilated cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrest, and sudden death. Extra-cardiac features involving the nervous system and eyes have also been reported.4–7 DUFB11 variants have recently been independently proposed to cause histiocytoid cardiomyopathy. The efficacy of CA of PVCs triggering VF or polymorphic VT in idiopathic VF or channelopathies has been reported.2,3,8 Those PVCs could arise from the Purkinje system. Ablation therapy has also been reported in two cases of histiocytoid cardiomyopathy and VT, but the outcomes were far from satisfactory.9,10 The ablation target was the Purkinje tissue and anterior left bundle of His. One patient survived after a heart transplantation, and the other died of a cerebral haemorrhage after VAD therapy.9,10 Our case was a successful ablation of PVCs triggering TdP at the earliest ventricular sites. The patient died of uncontrolled heart failure due to cardiomyopathy 2 months later as a result.\\n\\nThe mechanism of ScTdP remains unclear, but it is assumed to be an unstable re-entry in the Purkinje network or triggered activity in the Purkinje cells. Histiocytoid cells are thought to correspond to abnormal Purkinje cells.11 In the case presented here, abnormal cells were occupying the subendocardium areas in both ventricles, while no fibrotic tissues were observed in those areas. Based on the pathological and electrophysiological findings, the PVCs were likely caused by triggered activity and associated with abnormal Purkinje cells. The perpetuation of the VT could have been caused by re-entry in the injured Purkinje network, because ablation of the narrow area in the RV suppressed the TdP.\\n\\nParticular attention should be given to the safety of CA in small patients. The expert consensus for CA is that VT with a deteriorating ventricular function is a Class I indication, even in infants, if medical therapy is not effective.1 We applied radiofrequency energy for 60\\u2009s for a total of 14 times at two different sites with the temperature control set below 55°C and a power limit of 30\\u2009W. Histopathology revealed the formation of transmural lesions replaced by fibrous tissue in the RV wall but not in the epicardium. This finding was quite satisfactory in terms of the adequacy of the depth of the ablation. At this level, abnormal cells associated with arrhythmias would have been eliminated without damaging the coronary arteries in the epicardium.\\n\\nConclusion\\nThe PVCs triggering TdP were successfully ablated in a 4-month-old girl with histiocytoid cardiomyopathy.

      "Predicting with title: High-dose chemotherapy with autologous peripheral blood stem cell support for recurrent primary AFP-producing intracranial germinoma., context: ['We report of a 34-year old man with second intracranial relapse of a suprasellar germinoma. Despite of extensive pretreatment with radiation and conventional chemotherapy relapse occurred and was treated with sequential high-dose chemotherapy followed by transfusion of autologous peripheral stem cells. The high-dose chemotherapy course was complicated by refractory derailment of pineal gland insufficiency. The patient achieved a complete remission after high dose chemotherapy which lasted for 13 months. Subsequently, he developed a third relapse and died.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nTumors of the pineal gland are rare accounting for 0.4 - 1% of all primary tumors of the brain [1]. Different tumor types are found in the pineal region: tumors that derive from germ cells (germinomas and \"non-germinomatous\" germ cell tumors like embryonic carcinomas and teratomas), from parenchymal cells (pinealoblastomas and pineocytomas), and from glial cells are encountered as well as lesions that represent non neoplastic cysts [2]. In all series germ cell tumors represent the most common histology (60%) [2]. The peak incidence of germ cell tumors is in the second decade [3]. In contrast to the other tumors mentioned which have no sex preference, germ cell tumors are more frequent in men than in women [1]. First symptoms are often neurological signs and complaints caused by an obstructive hydrocephalus with headache, nausea, and vomiting and/or involvement of ocular pathways. Determination of histology, tumor markers in serum and CSF, and extent of disease are critical for optimal management of pineal region tumors. Five year survival rates following radiation range from 44 - 78% and depend on extent of disease, age, radiation volume and dose to the primary site but primarily on histology [4]. The five year survival of patients with germinoma is 76% as compared with 21% for those with a \"non-germinomatous\" germ cell tumor. \\n\\nThere is no established therapy for relapsing or refractory intracranial germinoma. In analogy to germinomas of the testis a higher curability may be expected with high dose chemotherapy followed by autologous blood stem-cell retransfusion [5]. For non germinomatous tumors no guidelines exist with respect to dosage, combination or sequence of chemotherapy and radiation.\\n\\nCase presentation\\nA 25-year old man became symptomatic by diabetes insipidus. Further examination revealed that these symptoms were caused by a primary AFP producing germinoma of the pineal gland. The initial treatment in 1987 consisted of radiation of the tumor with 30 Gy which resulted in a complete remission.'], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: High-dose chemotherapy with autologous peripheral blood stem cell support for recurrent primary AFP-producing intracranial germinoma., context: ['Seven years later he developed a first relapse in the anterior section of the first ventricle with infiltration of brain parenchyma, and extension to the intradural and extradural lumbosacral spinal canal. The spinal tumor was irradiated with 30 Gy. Immediately after radiation he was treated with  high dose methotrexate 12 g/m² i.v. on day 1 (total dose 20 g). Three weeks later chemotherapy according to the PEB-protocol was initiated: cisplatin 20 mg/m² i.v. d1-d5, etoposide 100 mg/m² i.v. d1-d5, and bleomycin 30 mg i.v. d1, 8, and 15. Four cycles were administered. In order to prevent bleomycin induced lung damage bleomycin was replaced by ifosfamide 1200 mg/m² i.v. twice daily (d1-d5) in two additional cycles. These six cycles resulted in a total dose of cisplatin 1070 mg, etoposide 4800 mg, bleomycin 395 mg, ifosfamide 24.5 g. Staging three weeks after termination of the chemotherapy showed a complete remission of the brain lesion. Residual masses in the spinal areas were interpreted as representing most likely a scar. AFP had returned to normal values.\\n\\nAnother 10 months later the patient suffered from a second relapse localized again in the anterior section of the ventricle at the same location as the first relapse and additionally in the roof of the left ventricle. The spinal tumors had an equal size compared to prior relapse. The AFP level at this time was increased up to 69 U/l.\\n\\nThe patient was treated with a high dose chemotherapy followed by retransfusion of autologous stem cells. Stem cell harvesting was successful after one cycle according to the PEI-protocol with cisplatin 25 mg/m² i.v. twice daily d2-4 (total dose 170 mg), etoposide 100 mg/m² i.v. once daily d1-d5 (total dose 860 mg), and ifosfamide 1.5 g twice daily i.v. d1-d5 (total dose 13 g). From day 10 the patient received filgrastim (Neupogen®) 5 µg/kg s.c. for stem cell mobilisation. The harvest of three apheresis were enough for performing two cycles of high dose chemotherapy (>2 x 106 CD 34 pos. cells/kg). After hematologic reconstitution the patient underwent two cycles of high dose chemotherapy according to the CEI-protocol (cumulative dose of carboplatin 375 mg/m² i.v.) twice daily d1-d5 (total dose of two cycles 5000 mg), etoposide 310 mg/m² i.v. twice daily d1-d5 (total dose of two cycles 4100 mg), and ifosfamide 2.5 g/m² i. v. twice daily (total dose of two cycles 33 g) each followed by reinfusion of autologous peripheral blood stem cells. The two cycles were completed within 36 days. The patient remained aplastic (WBC < 1G/l, thrombocytes <20 G/l) for 7 and 9 days, respectively. After treatment AFP decreased to 9.6 U/ml and the tumor manifestation in the brain disappeared. Again the lesions in the spinal areas were constant in size.'], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: High-dose chemotherapy with autologous peripheral blood stem cell support for recurrent primary AFP-producing intracranial germinoma., context: ['The therapy was complicated by a global insufficiency of the pineal gland. Since first cranial radiation he received antidiuretic hormones (ADH) applied as a nasal spray. During the high dose chemotherapy with fluid intakes up to 4 liter - to prevent cisplatin induced renal damage - his urine production increased up to 13 liter/24 hours after therapy. This pattern was refractory under increase of ADH, and under substitution of mineralocorticoids. The serum electrolytes remained stable under substitution. After termination of chemotherapy the urine production went back to normal. Other endocrinologic functions remained stable during chemotherapy. \\n\\nThe patient remained in stable remission  for a period of 13 months until a third relapse. The tumor was then localized in the roof of the left ventricle and in the brain stem. This third relapse was complicated by seizures which resolved under high dose dexamethasone therapy. Because of extensive pretreatment with chemotherapy the patients underwent cerebral radiation with another 30 Gy, so the total dose to the brain was 60 Gy. Despite slow reconstitution of the performance status the patient died one month later at home most likely due to an electrolyte derailment.\\n\\nDiscussion\\nDespite of considerable advances in the treatment of patients with germ cell tumors, certain patients, especially those who relapse after radiation and/or chemotherapy fare poorly [6] [7]. Guidelines have not yet been defined for therapy of relapsed and/or refractory germinoma of the pineal gland. Considering that germ cell tumors of the pineal gland have  biological similarities to germ cell tumors of the testis, the patient was treated at second relapse with high dose chemotherapy and stem cell support in analogy to treatment protocols for systemic germ cell tumors [5].\\n\\nTo date there are no reports on adult patients with relapse of a pineal germinoma treated with high dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation. Kimura et al reported of a patient with a primary β-HCG producing cerebral germinoma who gained a complete remission after high dose chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation [8]. Graham et al reported about a heterogeneous group of brain tumors in 49 children (two children with germ cell tumors) treated with different high dose chemotherapy regimens followed by autologous marrow rescue [9]. Both children were alive and had no evidence of disease 30 and 20 months respectively after treatment.

However, in the most cases the duration of second or third remission is shorter than the first remission. The third remission gained after high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation had a three months longer duration than his second remission.\\n\\nHigh-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell support is a potentially curative treatment for patients with relapsed or high risk (metastatic disease) germinomas of the pineal gland.

The disease often is normally difficult to diagnose due to its broad range of characters without specific symptoms. A 62-year-old male patient presented with heart failure after experiencing a long period of unexplained and untreated gastrointestinal symptoms. Clinical examination and laboratory findings indicated a systemic process with cardiac involvement. Echocardiography revealed concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with enhanced echogenicity and preserved ejection fraction. Rectum biopsy confirmed amyloid deposition. The side effect of delayed diagnosis on prognosis and the appropriate diagnostic strategy has been discussed.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nLight-chain (AL) amyloidosis is a disorder characterized by deposition of insoluble, monoclonal immunoglobulin light-chain fragments in various tissues. Clinical features depend on organs involved but can include restrictive cardiomyopathy, nephrotic syndrome, hepatic failure, and peripheral/autonomic neuropathy. The patients often have a long period of a certain organ involved before systemic multiorgan involvement or heart failure has already developed. Cardiac involvement is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, especially in AL amyloidosis.1 Once congestive heart failure occurs in AL amyloidosis, median survival is less than 6 months if left untreated. Thus, an early and accurate diagnosis with an earlier start or more intensive treatment may have resulted in a better outcome.\\n\\nCase report\\nA 62-year-old male presented with a 15-day history of dyspnea on exertion, associated with both lower extremity edema. Before this admission, he also had suffered from abdominal bloating and tasteless for a year with noticeable body weight loss at the same time (up to 20 kg). Over the past 6 months, he developed a multiple system disorder, which included painless paresthesias in the lower limbs, erectile dysfunction, and chronic diarrhea. He had an average stool frequency of up to ten times per day, with no obvious blood or mucus and no abdominal pain or tenesmus. Unfortunately, previous stomach and rectum biopsy did not examine for accumulations of amyloid fibril protein. His family history was unremarkable.\\n\\nOn physical examination, his blood pressure was 82/56 mmHg and heart rate was 52 bpm. Significant jugular venous distention, moderate hepatomegaly, and lower extremity edema were noted. A neurological examination revealed weakness and muscular atrophy in the bilateral tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius. Hyporeflexia was noted on both knees and ankles. Sensory examination revealed diminished tactile and pain sensation in a stocking and glove pattern and vibratory sensation was distally reduced in the lower limbs. The motor and sensory functions of upper extremities were relatively spared.'], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: Light-chain cardiac amyloidosis with neuropathy: a case report., context: ['Initial laboratory data that included full blood count, transaminase, creatinine, electrolytes, cardiac troponin, and thyroid function were normal or negative. N-terminal fragment of pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) was 3,996 pg/mL. Nerve conduction studies confirmed bilateral sensory-motor neuropathy (Table 1). An electromyography study demonstrated active denervation and chronic reinnervation changes in the tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius. Electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed sinus rhythm, low voltages in limb leads, QS waves in precordial and inferior leads, first-degree atrioventricular block, and prolonged QTc (Figure 1). Two-dimensional echocardiography revealed marked concentrically thickened and speckled appearance of ventricular walls, biatrial dilatation, and left ventricular ejection fraction of 70% (Figure 2). Doppler revealed a severe restrictive mitral filling pattern with E/A ratio 2.1. Coronary angiography findings were normal.\\n\\nThe combined occurrence of low QRS voltage in the ECG, ventricular thickening, and signs of diastolic dysfunction is strongly suggestive of cardiac amyloidosis. The following serum λ light-chain concentration was 1,763 (normal range: 598–1,329 mg/dL, and κ light-chain concentration was normal. Rectum biopsy confirmed amyloid infiltrate (Figure 3). So, the diagnosis of AL amyloidosis was established. Despite chemotherapy administration of melphalan, dexamethasone, immunomodulator lenalidomide, and supportive therapy including montmorillonite to decrease diarrhea and low-dose furosemide to alleviate fluid retention, the patient continued to deteriorate and died at home after 3 months after the initial diagnosis.\\n\\nDiscussion\\nAmyloidosis refers to a collection of conditions in which abnormal protein folding results in insoluble fibril deposition in tissues. The major types of amyloidosis, classified on the basis of their precursor protein, include light-chain, senile systemic (wild-type transthyretin), hereditary (mutant transthyretin), and secondary (AA) diseases. The frequency of cardiac involvement varies among the types of amyloidosis and is common with AL disease.2 Myocardial amyloid involvement leads to a restrictive cardiac physiology with possible concomitant conduction system disease, and the patients may present with nonspecific dyspnea, lower extremity edema, and syncope.

      "Predicting with title: Light-chain cardiac amyloidosis with neuropathy: a case report., context: ['Echocardiography should be the first noninvasive test performed to evaluate for cardiac amyloidosis. Echocardiographic findings include biatrial dilatation and increased left ventricular wall thickness with diastolic dysfunction. Ejection fraction is generally preserved. These findings are also prevalent in other cardiac conditions such as hypertrophic nonobstructive cardiomyopathy. However, ECG of our patient revealed low voltages, which was not typical for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Increased myocardial echogenicity with a granular or sparkling appearance is the most characteristic feature, as seen in the case. But this feature has limited sensitivity in cardiac amyloidosis and may be more indicative of late-stage disease. Advanced echocardiographic techniques are beginning to reveal more about the underlying pathology and functional abnormalities. With the tissue Doppler imaging technique, measurement of myocardial tissue velocity allows detection of early diastolic wall motion abnormalities before development of heart failure. However, a limitation of tissue Doppler imaging lies in its inability to distinguish between actively contracting myocardium and adjacent tethered akinetic myocardial segments. This limitation can be overcome by strain and strain rate imaging, which derives from speckle tracking imaging and is better able to distinguish among segmental wall motion differences.3 It is particularly helpful and demonstrates a very typical pattern in cardiac amyloidosis, characterized by relative sparing of apical longitudinal contraction compared to basal contraction. This appearance is not typically seen in other cardiomyopathies such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and aortic stenosis.\\n\\nThe use of a combination of echocardiographic and electrocardiographic features increases specificity. A low voltage on the ECG and increased septal and posterior left ventricle wall thickness on the echocardiogram are highly specific for cardiac amyloidosis in the setting of biopsy-proven systemic amyloidosis. Low QRS voltages (all limb leads <5 mm in height) with poor R-wave progression in the chest leads (pseudoinfarction pattern) occur in up to 50% of patients with cardiac AL amyloidosis, and this is the most common finding in affected individuals. Ischemic cardiomyopathy may also result in decreased voltages and infarction pattern on ECG but leads to dilated, eccentric ventricular hypertrophy with reduced ejection fraction.

Theoretically, typical echocardiographic appearances with a positive biopsy for amyloid, commonly from an extracardiac site (such as rectum or abdominal fat), is sufficient to make a diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis.5 Our patient had gastrointestinal symptoms, and the autonomic neuropathy has been considered to explain the symptoms. Biopsy from rectum confirmed amyloid infiltrate on Congo red staining.\\n\\nCardiac involvement is often a sign of advanced AL amyloidosis. In our case, the initial clinical presentation was dominated by chronic neuropathy and the diagnosis of AL amyloidosis took 1 year after the first symptom.

There are two types of amyloid that commonly infiltrate the nerve system. The first is familial amyloid polyneuropathy (also known as hereditary amyloidosis).6 The second is AL amyloidosis. Peripheral neuropathy occurs in 17% of patients with AL amyloidosis, making it the most common type of acquired amyloid polyneuropathy. Sensory-motor axonal polyneuropathy and carpal tunnel syndrome are the most common types of neuropathy associated with AL amyloidosis. Symptoms typically begin with painful paresthesias in the feet signifying small fiber involvement. As the disease progresses, it can affect larger nerve fibers and patients may complain of numbness and motor weakness.7 Up to 65% of patients with peripheral neuropathy also have autonomic nervous system involvement. The clinical manifestations of autonomic disorders are nonspecific and symptoms can include nausea, vomiting, early satiety, bloating, constipation, diarrhea, postural lightheadedness, and erectile dysfunction. Due to varying clinical symptoms, the diagnosis of amyloid neuropathy is often a challenge. However, it is important to recognize and distinguish neuropathy from diseases of the end organs themselves. Diagnostic testing can include electromyography/nerve conduction studies, autonomic function tests.8 In this case, early diagnosis is particularly crucial so that patients might undergo the appropriate testing to find cardiac involvement in early stage. The discovery of which might lead to life-saving interventions.\\n\\nConclusion\\nIn summary, AL amyloidosis is clinically heterogeneous with multisystem involvement. Presenting features are often nonspecific and difficult to characterize. Often, the discovery of cardiac involvement is a sign of late-stage disease. Increasing medical alertness of the natural history of AL amyloidosis could reduce the time to achieve the diagnosis and therapeutic decisions, also improving the prognosis.

      "Predicting with title: Transient hypercortisolism and symptomatic hyperthyroidism associated to primary hyperparathyroidism in an elderly patient: case report and literature review., context: [\"BACKGROUND\\nPrimary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is often found on routine blood tests, at a relatively asymptomatic stage. However many studies suggest different systemic effects related to PHPT, which could be enhanced by an abnormal cortisol release due to chronic stress of hyperparathyroidism. Being PHPT frequently found in the 6(th) to 7(th) decade of life, a careful and multifaceted approach should be taken.\\n\\n\\nMETHODS\\nWe report the case of an elderly patient with symptomatic PHPT and incidental pulmonary embolism. He was treated with hydration, zoledronic acid, cinacalcet and high-dose unfractionated heparin. Parathyroid surgery was successfully performed, but patient's conditions suddenly worsened because of a transient thyrotoxicosis, probably induced by a previous exposure to iodine load and/or thyroid surgical manipulation. A short-term treatment with beta-blockers was introduced for symptomatic relief. The patient also presented a transient hypercortisolism with elevated ACTH, likely due to stress related not only to aging and hospitalization but also to PHPT, resolved only four months after parathyroid surgery.\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nChronic hyperparathyroidism has been linked with increased all-cause mortality. A functional chronic hypercortisolism could be established, enhancing PHPT related disorders. Only parathyroid surgery has been demonstrated to cure PHPT and complications related, showing similar outcome between older and younger patients. However, the management of post-operative period should be more careful in fragile patients. In particular, the early diagnosis and treatment of a transient post-operative thyrotoxicosis could improve recovery. Due to the increase in prevalence and the evidence of many related complications even in asymptomatic PHPT, expert opinion-based guidelines for surgical treatment of PHPT should be developed especially for elderly patients.\\n\\nBackground\\nPrimary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is the third most common endocrinopathy seen today, frequently found in the 6th to 7th decade of life. PHPT mainly is a sporadic disorder, caused in 85% of the cases by a single adenoma, in 15% by multi-gland disease and rarely by parathyroid carcinoma. Less than 10% of cases are inheritable, often associated with multi-gland hyperplasia. The most common presentation of PHPT is an asymptomatic hypercalcemia, incidentally found on routine blood tests. However, many patients may suffer from minimal symptoms such as asthenia, constipation, polyuria, hypertension and neuro-psychiatric complications [1]. In some cases a renal colic is the first presentation of the disease. In older patients, concomitant morbidity and poly-pharmacotherapy may worsen symptoms and complications, and impact the management of PHPT [2].\"], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: Transient hypercortisolism and symptomatic hyperthyroidism associated to primary hyperparathyroidism in an elderly patient: case report and literature review., context: ['In this paper we report a complex case of an elderly patient with symptomatic PHPT associated with a functional transient hypercortisolism, resolved only after parathyroid surgery. The post-operative period was also characterized by a symptomatic transient thyrotoxicosis, probably induced by previous exposure to iodine load and/or thyroid surgical manipulation. The early diagnosis and treatment of this condition improved final outcome.\\n\\nCase presentation\\nAn 80-year old man was admitted to a general hospital for polyuria, vomiting, weight loss, worsening asthenia, myalgia and progressive cognitive impairment. He had a personal history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes, treated with losartan and metformin respectively. On physical examination he was sleepy, apyretic, hypertensive (upright blood pressure 150/100\\xa0mmHg) and tachycardic (100 beats for minute). He did complain of dyspnea, dry skin and mucosa and muscle weakness, without bone pain and neurological alterations. Biochemical assays revealed hypernatremia (149\\xa0mmol/L), severe hypercalcemia (4.08\\xa0mmol/L), hypophosfatemia (0.62\\xa0mmol/L), elevated levels of PTH (252\\xa0ng/L), reduced vitamin D (32\\xa0nmol/L) and slight renal failure (urea 8.7\\xa0mmol/L, creatinine 112\\xa0μmol/L). Blood count, liver and thyroid function were normal (Table\\xa01). The electrocardiogram did not show remarkable signs of hypercalcemia. A cranial computed tomography (CT) scan excluded acute cerebrovascular events. A CT pulmonary angiography detected partial thrombosis in three segmental branches of the right upper lobe pulmonary artery. Doppler ultrasound (US) revealed a deep vein thrombosis of the left posterior tibial vein. The patient was treated with isotonic saline hydration, furosemide, supplementation of vitamin D and an injection of zoledronate 4\\xa0mg, with a mild improvement of hypercalcemia and related symptoms. Daily high-dose unfractionated heparin was also administered. The patient was then transferred to our Endocrine Unit and treated with cinacalcet, with decrease of PTH, calcemia and calciuria values. Amlodipine and insulin were also added for worsening hypertension and diabetes. Neck US revealed an enlarged thyroid with normal vascular pattern and at the lower pole of the left thyroid lobe a hypoechoic vascular nodule (14.7×10.5×9 mm), consistent with enlarged parathyroid. A sesta-MIBI scintigraphy showed a homogeneous tracer uptake over the thyroid in the early images and a remaining modest uptake in the lower left thyroid lobe in the later images; no other abnormal or ectopic uptake was found. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry revealed an osteopenia; all the radiological exams did not find brown tumors. Because of multiple co-morbidities, further investigations were performed to exclude other endocrine disorders: urinary metanephrine and normetanephrine values were normal, while plasma morning ACTH and daily urinary free cortisol were increased with impaired circadian cortisol rhythm, evaluated in two different measurements; serum cortisol after 1\\xa0mg overnight dexamethasone'], hint: None\n",

Direct abdomen CT was negative for adrenal diseases. Pituitary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidenced a round mass, about 4\\xa0mm, without enhancement after gadolinium injection, in the left lateral portion of adenohypophysis, consistent with microadenoma. Screening for mutations of MEN genes was negative. The other pituitary hormones were normal. Because of the patient’s general conditions and a probably stress-induced hypercortisolism, no other investigations were performed, giving priority to the surgical resolution of PHPT. Bilateral neck exploration was performed with removal of the upper right parathyroid and both the lower and the upper left parathyroid gland, with quick decrease of intra-operative PTH (from 1296 to 39\\xa0ng/L). The histological diagnosis was consistent with multi-glandular hyperplasia. Laboratory tests showed a decrease of calcium and PTH levels, treated with oral calcium and calcitriol. However, four days after surgery the patient developed a sinusal tachycardia, mild heart failure and agitation alternating with stupor, without evidence of infection nor of volemic imbalance. Further investigation revealed suppressed TSH, elevated free T4 and T3 values (Table\\xa01), with undetectable anti-thyroid and TSH receptor antibodies. Thyroid palpation was not painful. The post-operatory 99mTcO4 scintigraphy showed a reduced tracer uptake over the thyroid, especially in the lower left thyroid lobe, consistent with an inflammatory area (Figure\\xa01). Suspecting interference by the iodinated contrast used for pulmonary angio-CT about a month before, urinary iodine excretion was measured, resulting elevated (935\\xa0μg/L, normal range 100–200). Considering a possible dual pathogenesis of thyrotoxicosis, both destructive and iodine-induced, the patient was treated with atenolol for symptomatic relief. Two months after surgery, thyroid function and ioduria were normal and beta-blocker was progressively stopped; 1\\xa0mg overnight dexamethasone test (DST) was still pathological. After other two months, calcium-phosphate balance was normal and serum PTH was near the lower limit of normal, therefore calcium and calcitriol supplementation were continued. Adrenal function was finally normalized with adequate cortisol suppression after 1\\xa0mg overnight DST (Table\\xa01). Pituitary MRI confirmed the presence of a microadenoma, compatible with a non-secretory incidentaloma, in careful biochemical and radiological follow-up.Table 1 \\nPrincipal biochemical parameters of the patient before and after surgery for primary hyperparathyroidism\\n\\n\\nParameter\\tNormal range\\t1\\xa0month before surgery\\t4\\xa0days after surgery\\t4\\xa0months after surgery\\t\\nCa (mmol/L)\\t2,1-2,5\\t4,2\\t2,5\\t2,2\\t\\nP (mmol/L)\\t0,8-1,4\\t0,6\\t0,7\\t1,1\\t\\nPTH (ng/L)\\t5-27\\t252\\t<4\\t12\\t\\nACTH (ng/L)\\t10-50\\t128\\t126\\t38\\t\\nMorning salivary cortisol (ng/mL)\\t2,6-15,3\\t13,1\\t-\\t12,2\\t\\nLate-night salivary cortisol (ng/mL)\\t0,1-5,2\\t15,8\\t-\\t3,4\\t\\nDaily urinary cortisol (nmol/24\\xa0h)\\t30-193\\t557\\t281\\t80\\t\\nSerum cortisol after 1\\xa0mg DST (nmol/L)\\t<50\\t223\\t-\\t30'], hint: None\n",

The detection of hypercalcemia and elevated PTH levels was diagnostic of PHPT. The biochemical/clinical presentation could also raise the suspicion of parathyroid carcinoma, which was excluded by the histological examinations. Rehydration was the first measure to take in this patient, not only to correct dehydration and improve renal failure, but also to dilute calcium excretion. Bisphosphonate administration was effective in reducing calcium levels and bone resorption, in particular recent controlled trials demonstrated the superiority of zoledronate compared with previous treatments [3]. The addition of cinacalcet may be useful in the elderly or in not-surgical candidates, being well tolerated [4]. Parathyroid surgery is the only definite cure for PHPT, but the risks and benefits of surgery should be extensively considered in the elderly, given their more fragile state and co-morbidities [5]. Preoperative imaging with ultrasonography and scintigraphy may be helpful before elective surgery and in suspected parathyroid carcinoma, even if their sensitivity drops in detecting multi-glandular disease, as happened in our case report.\\n\\nOur finding of a transient thyrotoxicosis after parathyroid surgery could be due to a dual pathogenesis: a destructive thyroiditis and/or an iodine-induced hyperthyroidism. The first condition is fairly unknown and underestimated since the symptoms could be masked by other postoperative events [6]. Thyrotoxicosis seems to be related to an increased release of thyroid hormones and/or autoantigen during surgical manipulation, which could reactivate underlying autoimmune thyroiditis [7]. It could be influenced by other mechanisms, like preoperative hypercalcemic setting, pre-existing goiter and difficult parathyroid glands identification during surgical exploration [8]. Our patient had an euthyroid goiter, without abnormal MIBI-uptake in preoperative investigations nor previous or underlying autoimmune thyroiditis. Retrospectively, the only apparent risk factors were the goiter, the previous pronounced hypercalcemic condition and the occasional finding of a multi-gland disease.'], hint: None\n",
      "Predicting with title: Transient hypercortisolism and symptomatic hyperthyroidism associated to primary hyperparathyroidism in an elderly patient: case report and literature review., context: ['The second possible cause of transient thyrotoxicosis could be related to the previous iodinated contrast media exposure, leading to hypersecretion of thyroid hormones. This phenomenon, known as the Jod-Basedow effect, usually develops over 2 to 12\\xa0weeks, typically in old patients with underlying thyroid disease or living in areas of iodine deficiency. Exposure to a large iodine load can also cause acute destructive thyroiditis in people without pre-existing thyroid disorders [9]. TcO4-scintigraphy could not discriminate the cause of hyperthyroidism, since pertechnetate is trapped by thyroid, but not organified and the resulting tracer uptake may be reduced. As happened in our case, the assessment of urinary iodine concentration may be helpful [10]. Some researchers have investigated the incidence and the role of prophylactic measures to reduce the risk of iodine-induced thyrotoxicosis, without conclusive findings [11]. In our case the concomitant neck surgery could have been a precipitating factor in the pathogenesis of hyperthyroidism.\\n\\nBoth these conditions are usually self-limited and anti-thyroid drugs are not indicated. However, a short-term treatment with beta-blockers could be required for symptomatic relief, especially in fragile patients.\\n\\nSince chronic hyperparathyroidism has been linked with increased all-cause mortality, in asymptomatic and elderly patients the optimal timing for parathyroidectomy is controversial [12]. Cardiovascular complications are the leading cause of this increased mortality [13], linked not only to mineral homeostasis disruption but also to a direct effect of PTH on cardiovascular structures [14]. The complexity of PTH functions is further highlighted by data suggesting a bidirectional link between PTH and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system, playing a synergic role in enhancing metabolic and cardiovascular complications [15]. Several studies have also evidenced an altered hypotalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in PHPT, potentially contributing to cortical bone damage [16]. In vitro evidence supports a stimulatory effect of PTH on cortisol secretion [17] and of calcemia on ACTH release [18]. In vivo data show a hypercortisolism, loss of circadian rhythm and lack of cortisol suppression after low-dose DST in PHPT [19], which are not always recovered after surgical cure, as happened in our case.\\n\\nAlteration of cortisol expression and its circadian variability are also typical of aging, hospitalization, psychiatric and stress conditions [20]. False-positive results of the 1\\xa0mg DST could be influenced by absorption, liver or renal alterations and the use of alcohol or drugs inducing CYP3A4. Being PHPT a long-standing disease frequently affecting old patients, the activation of adrenal function seems to recall a functional hypercortisolism due to chronic stress, which could be preserved by aging and other co-morbidities, enhancing the damaging effects of prolonged exposure to stress hormones [21].'], hint: None\n",
